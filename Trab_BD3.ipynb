ha, cousin, is it not?\\n,In faith,\\n,It is a conquest for a prince to boast of\\n,Yea, there thou makest me sad and makest me sin\\n,In envy that my Lord Northumberland\\n,Should be the father to so blest a son,\\n,A son who is the theme of honours tongue,\\n,Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant,\\n,Who is sweet Fortunes minion and her pride:\\n,Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,\\n,See riot and dishonour stain the brow\\n,Of my young Harry O that it could be proved\\n,That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged\\n,In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,\\n,And calld mine Percy, his Plantagenet!\\n,Then would I have his Harry, and he mine\\n,But let him from my thoughts What think you, coz,\\n,Of this young Percys pride? the prisoners,\\n,Which he in this adventure hath surprised,\\n,To his own use he keeps, and sends me word,\\n,I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife\\n,This is his uncles teaching, this is Worcester,\\n,Malevolent to you in all aspects,\\n,Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up\\n,The crest of youth against your dignity\\n,But I have sent for him to answer this,\\n,And for this cause awhile we must neglect\\n,Our holy purpose to Jerusalem\\n,Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we\\n,Will hold at Windsor, so inform the lords:\\n,But come yourself with speed to us again,\\n,For more is to be said and to be done\\n,Than out of anger can be uttered\\n,I will, my liege\\n,Exeunt\\n, II London An apartment of the Princes\\n,Enter the PRINCE OF WALES and FALSTAFF\\n,Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?\\n,Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack\\n,and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon\\n,benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to\\n,demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know\\n,What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the\\n,day? Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes\\n,capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the\\n,signs of leaping-houses and the blessed sun himself\\n,a fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta, I see no\\n,reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand\\n,the time of the day\\n,Indeed, you come near me now, Hal, for we that take\\n,purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not\\n,by Phoebus, he,that wandering knight so fair And,\\n,I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as, God\\n,save thy grace,majesty I should say, for grace\\n,thou wilt have none,\\n,What, none?\\n,No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to\\n,prologue to an egg and butter\\n,Well, how then? come, roundly, roundly\\n,Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not\\n,us that are squires of the nights body be called\\n,thieves of the days beauty: let us be Dianas\\n,foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the\\n,moon, and let men say we be men of good government,\\n,being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and\\n,chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal\\n,Thou sayest well, and it holds well too, for the\\n,fortune of us that are the moons men doth ebb and\\n,flow like the sea, being governed, as the sea is,\\n,by the moon As, for proof, now: a purse of gold\\n,most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most\\n,dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning, got with\\n,swearing Lay by and spent with crying Bring in,\\n,now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder\\n,and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows\\n,By the Lord, thou sayest true, lad And is not my\\n,hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?\\n,As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle And\\n,is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?\\n,How now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy quips and\\n,thy quiddities? what a plague have I to do with a\\n,buff jerkin?\\n,Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?\\n,Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning many a\\n,time and oft\\n,Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?\\n,No, Ill give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there\\n,Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch,\\n,and where it would not, I have used my credit\\n,Yea, and so used it that were it not here apparent\\n,that thou art heir apparentBut, I prithee, sweet\\n,wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when\\n,thou art king? and resolution thus fobbed as it is\\n,with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do\\n,not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief\\n,No, thou shalt\\n,Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, Ill be a brave judge\\n,Thou judgest false already: I mean, thou shalt have\\n,the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman\\n,Well, Hal, well, and in some sort it jumps with my\\n,humour as well as waiting in the court, I can tell\\n,you\\n,For obtaining of suits?\\n,Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman\\n,hath no lean wardrobe Sblood, I am as melancholy\\n,as a gib cat or a lugged bear\\n,Or an old lion, or a lovers lute\\n,Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe\\n,What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of\\n,Moor-ditch?\\n,Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed\\n,the most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young\\n,prince But, Hal, I prithee, trouble me no more\\n,with vanity I would to God thou and I knew where a\\n,commodity of good names were to be bought An old\\n,lord of the council rated me the other day in the\\n,street about you, sir, but I marked him not, and yet\\n,he talked very wisely, but I regarded him not, and\\n,yet he talked wisely, and in the street too\\n,Thou didst well, for wisdom cries out in the\\n,streets, and no man regards it\\n,O, thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able\\n,to corrupt a saint Thou hast done much harm upon\\n,me, Hal, God forgive thee for it! Before I knew\\n,thee, Hal, I knew nothing, and now am I, if a man\\n,should speak truly, little better than one of the\\n,wicked I must give over this life, and I will give\\n,it over: by the Lord, and I do not, I am a villain:\\n,Ill be damned for never a kings son in\\n,Christendom\\n,Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?\\n,Zounds, where thou wilt, lad, Ill make one, an I\\n,do not, call me villain and baffle me\\n,I see a good amendment of life in thee, from praying\\n,to purse-taking\\n,Why, Hal, tis my vocation, Hal, tis no sin for a\\n,man to labour in his vocation\\n,Enter POINS\\n,Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a\\n,match O, if men were to be saved by merit, what\\n,hole in hell were hot enough for him? This is the\\n,most omnipotent villain that ever cried Stand to\\n,a true man\\n,Good morrow, Ned\\n,Good morrow, sweet Hal What says Monsieur Remorse?\\n,what says Sir John Sack and Sugar? Jack! how\\n,agrees the devil and thee about thy soul, that thou\\n,soldest him on Good-Friday last for a cup of Madeira\\n,and a cold capons leg?\\n,Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall have\\n,his bargain, for he was never yet a breaker of\\n,proverbs: he will give the devil his due\\n,Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil\\n,Else he had been damned for cozening the devil\\n,But, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning, by four\\n,oclock, early at Gadshill! there are pilgrims going\\n,to Canterbury with rich offerings, and traders\\n,riding to London with fat purses: I have vizards\\n,for you all, you have horses for yourselves:\\n,Gadshill lies to-night in Rochester: I have bespoke\\n,supper to-morrow night in Eastcheap: we may do it\\n,as secure as sleep If you will go, I will stuff\\n,your purses full of crowns, if you will not, tarry\\n,at home and be hanged\\n,Hear ye, Yedward, if I tarry at home and go not,\\n,Ill hang you for going\\n,You will, chops?\\n,Hal, wilt thou make one?\\n,Who, I rob? I a thief? not I, by my faith\\n,Theres neither honesty, manhood, nor good\\n,fellowship in thee, nor thou camest not of the blood\\n,royal, if thou darest not stand for ten shillings\\n,Well then, once in my days Ill be a madcap\\n,Why, thats well said\\n,Well, come what will, Ill tarry at home\\n,By the Lord, Ill be a traitor then, when thou art king\\n,I care not\\n,Sir John, I prithee, leave the prince and me alone:\\n,I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure\\n,that he shall go\\n,Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion and him\\n,the ears of profiting, that what thou speakest may\\n,move and what he hears may be believed, that the\\n,true prince may, for recreation sake, prove a false\\n,thief, for the poor abuses of the time want\\n,countenance Farewell: you shall find me in Eastcheap\\n,Farewell, thou latter spring! farewell, All-hallown summer!\\n,Exit Falstaff\\n,Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us\\n,to-morrow: I have a jest to execute that I cannot\\n,manage alone Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto and Gadshill\\n,shall rob those men that we have already waylaid:\\n,yourself and I will not be there, and when they\\n,have the booty, if you and I do not rob them, cut\\n,this head off from my shoulders\\n,How shall we part with them in setting forth?\\n,Why, we will set forth before or after them, and\\n,appoint them a place of meeting, wherein it is at\\n,our pleasure to fail, and then will they adventure\\n,upon the exploit themselves, which they shall have\\n,no sooner achieved, but well set upon them\\n,Yea, but tis like that they will know us by our\\n,horses, by our habits and by every other\\n,appointment, to be ourselves\\n,Tut! our horses they shall not see: Ill tie them\\n,in the wood, our vizards we will change after we\\n,leave them: and, sirrah, I have cases of buckram\\n,for the nonce, to immask our noted outward garments\\n,Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us\\n,Well, for two of them, I know them to be as\\n,true-bred cowards as ever turned back, and for the\\n,third, if he fight longer than he sees reason, Ill\\n,forswear arms The virtue of this jest will be, the\\n,incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will\\n,tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty, at\\n,least, he fought with, what wards, what blows, what\\n,extremities he endured, and in the reproof of this\\n,lies the jest\\n,Well, Ill go with thee: provide us all things\\n,necessary and meet me to-morrow night in Eastcheap,\\n,there Ill sup Farewell\\n,Farewell, my lord\\n,Exit Poins\\n,I know you all, and will awhile uphold\\n,The unyoked humour of your idleness:\\n,Yet herein will I imitate the sun,\\n,Who doth permit the base contagious clouds\\n,To smother up his beauty from the world,\\n,That, when he please again to be himself,\\n,Being wanted, he may be more wonderd at,\\n,By breaking through the foul and ugly mists\\n,Of vapours that did seem to strangle him\\n,If all the year were playing holidays,\\n,To sport would be as tedious as to work,\\n,But when they seldom come, they wishd for come,\\n,And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents\\n,So, when this loose behavior I throw off\\n,And pay the debt I never promised,\\n,By how much better than my word I am,\\n,By so much shall I falsify mens hopes,\\n,And like bright metal on a sullen ground,\\n,My reformation, glittering oer my fault,\\n,Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes\\n,Than that which hath no foil to set it off\\n,Ill so offend, to make offence a skill,\\n,Redeeming time when men think least I will\\n,Exit\\n, III London The palace\\n,Enter the KING, NORTHUMBERLAND, WORCESTER, HOTSPUR, SIR WALTER BLUNT, with others\\n,My blood hath been too cold and temperate,\\n,Unapt to stir at these indignities,\\n,And you have found me, for accordingly\\n,You tread upon my patience: but be sure\\n,I will from henceforth rather be myself,\\n,Mighty and to be feard, than my condition,\\n,Which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,\\n,And therefore lost that title of respect\\n,Which the proud soul neer pays but to the proud\\n,Our house, my sovereign liege, little deserves\\n,The scourge of greatness to be used on it,\\n,And that same greatness too which our own hands\\n,Have holp to make so portly\\n,My lord\\n,Worcester, get thee gone, for I do see\\n,Danger and disobedience in thine eye:\\n,O, sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,\\n,And majesty might never yet endure\\n,The moody frontier of a servant brow\\n,You have good leave to leave us: when we need\\n,Your use and counsel, we shall send for you\\n,Exit Worcester\\n,You were about to speak\\n,To North\\n,Yea, my good lord\\n,Those prisoners in your highness name demanded,\\n,Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,\\n,Were, as he says, not with such strength denied\\n,As is deliverd to your majesty:\\n,Either envy, therefore, or misprison\\n,Is guilty of this fault and not my son\\n,My liege, I did deny no prisoners\\n,But I remember, when the fight was done,\\n,When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,\\n,Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,\\n,Came there a certain lord, neat, and trimly dressd,\\n,Fresh as a bridegroom, and his chin new reapd\\n,Showd like a stubble-land at harvest-home,\\n,He was perfumed like a milliner,\\n,And twixt his finger and his thumb he held\\n,A pouncet-box, which ever and anon\\n,He gave his nose and tookt away again,\\n,Who therewith angry, when it next came there,\\n,Took it in snuff, and still he smiled and talkd,\\n,And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,\\n,He calld them untaught knaves, unmannerly,\\n,To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse\\n,Betwixt the wind and his nobility\\n,With many holiday and lady terms\\n,He questiond me, amongst the rest, demanded\\n,My prisoners in your majestys behalf\\n,I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,\\n,To be so pesterd with a popinjay,\\n,Out of my grief and my impatience,\\n,Answerd neglectingly I know not what,\\n,He should or he should not, for he made me mad\\n,To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet\\n,And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman\\n,Of guns and drums and wounds,God save the mark!\\n,And telling me the sovereignst thing on earth\\n,Was parmaceti for an inward bruise,\\n,And that it was great pity, so it was,\\n,This villanous salt-petre should be diggd\\n,Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,\\n,Which many a good tall fellow had destroyd\\n,So cowardly, and but for these vile guns,\\n,He would himself have been a soldier\\n,This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,\\n,I answerd indirectly, as I said,\\n,And I beseech you, let not his report\\n,Come current for an accusation\\n,Betwixt my love and your high majesty\\n,The circumstance considerd, good my lord,\\n,Whateer Lord Harry Percy then had said\\n,To such a person and in such a place,\\n,At such a time, with all the rest retold,\\n,May reasonably die and never rise\\n,To do him wrong or any way impeach\\n,What then he said, so he unsay it now\\n,Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners,\\n,But with proviso and exception,\\n,That we at our own charge shall ransom straight\\n,His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer,\\n,Who, on my soul, hath wilfully betrayd\\n,The lives of those that he did lead to fight\\n,Against that great magician, damnd Glendower,\\n,Whose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March\\n,Hath lately married Shall our coffers, then,\\n,Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?\\n,Shall we but treason? and indent with fears,\\n,When they have lost and forfeited themselves?\\n,No, on the barren mountains let him starve,\\n,For I shall never hold that man my friend\\n,Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost\\n,To ransom home revolted Mortimer\\n,Revolted Mortimer!\\n,He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,\\n,But by the chance of war, to prove that true\\n,Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,\\n,Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took\\n,When on the gentle Severns sedgy bank,\\n,In single opposition, hand to hand,\\n,He did confound the best part of an hour\\n,In changing hardiment with great Glendower:\\n,Three times they breathed and three times did\\n,they drink,\\n,Upon agreement, of swift Severns flood,\\n,Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,\\n,Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,\\n,And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,\\n,Bloodstained with these valiant combatants\\n,Never did base and rotten policy\\n,Colour her working with such deadly wounds,\\n,Nor could the noble Mortimer\\n,Receive so many, and all willingly:\\n,Then let not him be slanderd with revolt\\n,Thou dost belie him, Percy, thou dost belie him,\\n,He never did encounter with Glendower:\\n,I tell thee,\\n,He durst as well have met the devil alone\\n,As Owen Glendower for an enemy\\n,Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth\\n,Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer:\\n,Send me your prisoners with the speediest means,\\n,Or you shall hear in such a kind from me\\n,As will displease you My Lord Northumberland,\\n,We licence your departure with your son\\n,Send us your prisoners, or you will hear of it\\n,Exeunt King Henry, Blunt, and train\\n,An if the devil come and roar for them,\\n,I will not send them: I will after straight\\n,And tell him so, for I will ease my heart,\\n,Albeit I make a hazard of my head\\n,What, drunk with choler? stay and pause awhile:\\n,Here comes your uncle\\n,Re-enter WORCESTER\\n,Speak of Mortimer!\\n,Zounds, I will speak of him, and let my soul\\n,Want mercy, if I do not join with him:\\n,Yea, on his part Ill empty all these veins,\\n,And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust,\\n,But I will lift the down-trod Mortimer\\n,As high in the air as this unthankful king,\\n,As this ingrate and cankerd Bolingbroke\\n,Brother, the king hath made your nephew mad\\n,Who struck this heat up after I was gone?\\n,He will, forsooth, have all my prisoners,\\n,And when I urged the ransom once again\\n,Of my wifes brother, then his cheek lookd pale,\\n,And on my face he turnd an eye of death,\\n,Trembling even at the name of Mortimer\\n,I cannot blame him: was not he proclaimd\\n,By Richard that dead is the next of blood?\\n,He was, I heard the proclamation:\\n,And then it was when the unhappy king,\\n,Whose wrongs in us God pardon!did set forth\\n,Upon his Irish expedition,\\n,From whence he intercepted did return\\n,To be deposed and shortly murdered\\n,And for whose death we in the worlds wide mouth\\n,Live scandalized and foully spoken of\\n,But soft, I pray you, did King Richard then\\n,Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer\\n,Heir to the crown?\\n,He did, myself did hear it\\n,Nay, then I cannot blame his cousin king,\\n,That wished him on the barren mountains starve\\n,But shall it be that you, that set the crown\\n,Upon the head of this forgetful man\\n,And for his sake wear the detested blot\\n,Of murderous subornation, shall it be,\\n,That you a world of curses undergo,\\n,Being the agents, or base second means,\\n,The cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather?\\n,O, pardon me that I descend so low,\\n,To show the line and the predicament\\n,Wherein you range under this subtle king,\\n,Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,\\n,Or fill up chronicles in time to come,\\n,That men of your nobility and power\\n,Did gage them both in an unjust behalf,\\n,As both of youGod pardon it!have done,\\n,To put down Richard, that sweet lovely rose,\\n,An plant this thorn, this canker, Bolingbroke?\\n,And shall it in more shame be further spoken,\\n,That you are foold, discarded and shook off\\n,By him for whom these shames ye underwent?\\n,No, yet time serves wherein you may redeem\\n,Your banishd honours and restore yourselves\\n,Into the good thoughts of the world again,\\n,Revenge the jeering and disdaind contempt\\n,Of this proud king, who studies day and night\\n,To answer all the debt he owes to you\\n,Even with the bloody payment of your deaths:\\n,Therefore, I say\\n,Peace, cousin, say no more:\\n,And now I will unclasp a secret book,\\n,And to your quick-conceiving discontents\\n,Ill read you matter deep and dangerous,\\n,As full of peril and adventurous spirit\\n,As to oer-walk a current roaring loud\\n,On the unsteadfast footing of a spear\\n,If he fall in, good night! or sink or swim:\\n,Send danger from the east unto the west,\\n,So honour cross it from the north to south,\\n,And let them grapple: O, the blood more stirs\\n,To rouse a lion than to start a hare!\\n,Imagination of some great exploit\\n,Drives him beyond the bounds of patience\\n,By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap,\\n,To pluck bright honour from the pale-faced moon,\\n,Or dive into the bottom of the deep,\\n,Where fathom-line could never touch the ground,\\n,And pluck up drowned honour by the locks,\\n,So he that doth redeem her thence might wear\\n,Without corrival, all her dignities:\\n,But out upon this half-faced fellowship!\\n,He apprehends a world of figures here,\\n,But not the form of what he should attend\\n,Good cousin, give me audience for a while\\n,I cry you mercy\\n,Those same noble Scots\\n,That are your prisoners,\\n,Ill keep them all,\\n,By God, he shall not have a Scot of them,\\n,No, if a Scot would save his soul, he shall not:\\n,Ill keep them, by this hand\\n,You start away\\n,And lend no ear unto my purposes\\n,Those prisoners you shall keep\\n,Nay, I will, thats flat:\\n,He said he would not ransom Mortimer,\\n,Forbad my tongue to speak of Mortimer,\\n,But I will find him when he lies asleep,\\n,And in his ear Ill holla Mortimer!\\n,Nay,\\n,Ill have a starling shall be taught to speak\\n,Nothing but Mortimer, and give it him\\n,To keep his anger still in motion\\n,Hear you, cousin, a word\\n,All studies here I solemnly defy,\\n,Save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke:\\n,And that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales,\\n,But that I think his father loves him not\\n,And would be glad he met with some mischance,\\n,I would have him poisond with a pot of ale\\n,Farewell, kinsman: Ill talk to you\\n,When you are better temperd to attend\\n,Why, what a wasp-stung and impatient fool\\n,Art thou to break into this womans mood,\\n,Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own!\\n,Why, look you, I am whippd and scourged with rods,\\n,Nettled and stung with pismires, when I hear\\n,Of this vile politician, Bolingbroke\\n,In Richards time,what do you call the place?\\n,A plague upon it, it is in Gloucestershire,\\n,Twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept,\\n,His uncle York, where I first bowd my knee\\n,Unto this king of smiles, this Bolingbroke,\\n,Sblood!\\n,When you and he came back from Ravenspurgh\\n,At Berkley castle\\n,You say true:\\n,Why, what a candy deal of courtesy\\n,This fawning greyhound then did proffer me!\\n,Look,when his infant fortune came to age,\\n,And gentle Harry Percy, and kind cousin,\\n,O, the devil take such cozeners! God forgive me!\\n,Good uncle, tell your tale, I have done\\n,Nay, if you have not, to it again,\\n,We will stay your leisure\\n,I have done, i faith\\n,Then once more to your Scottish prisoners\\n,Deliver them up without their ransom straight,\\n,And make the Douglas son your only mean\\n,For powers in Scotland, which, for divers reasons\\n,Which I shall send you written, be assured,\\n,Will easily be granted You, my lord,\\n,To Northumberland\\n,Your son in Scotland being thus employd,\\n,Shall secretly into the bosom creep\\n,Of that same noble prelate, well beloved,\\n,The archbishop\\n,Of York, is it not?\\n,True, who bears hard\\n,His brothers death at Bristol, the Lord Scroop\\n,I speak not this in estimation,\\n,As what I think might be, but what I know\\n,Is ruminated, plotted and set down,\\n,And only stays but to behold the face\\n,Of that occasion that shall bring it on\\n,I smell it: upon my life, it will do well\\n,Before the game is afoot, thou still letst slip\\n,Why, it cannot choose but be a noble plot,\\n,And then the power of Scotland and of York,\\n,To join with Mortimer, ha?\\n,And so they shall\\n,In faith, it is exceedingly well aimd\\n,And tis no little reason bids us speed,\\n,To save our heads by raising of a head,\\n,For, bear ourselves as even as we can,\\n,The king will always think him in our debt,\\n,And think we think ourselves unsatisfied,\\n,Till he hath found a time to pay us home:\\n,And see already how he doth begin\\n,To make us strangers to his looks of love\\n,He does, he does: well be revenged on him\\n,Cousin, farewell: no further go in this\\n,Than I by letters shall direct your course\\n,When time is ripe, which will be suddenly,\\n,Ill steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer,\\n,Where you and Douglas and our powers at once,\\n,As I will fashion it, shall happily meet,\\n,To bear our fortunes in our own strong arms,\\n,Which now we hold at much uncertainty\\n,Farewell, good brother: we shall thrive, I trust\\n,Uncle, Adieu: O, let the hours be short\\n,Till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport!\\n,Exeunt\\n,\\n, I Rochester An inn yard\\n,Enter a Carrier with a lantern in his hand\\n,Heigh-ho! an it be not four by the day, Ill be\\n,hanged: Charles wain is over the new chimney, and\\n,yet our horse not packed What, ostler!\\n,[Within]   Anon, anon\\n,I prithee, Tom, beat Cuts saddle, put a few flocks\\n,in the point, poor jade, is wrung in the withers out\\n,of all cess\\n,Enter another Carrier\\n,Peas and beans are as dank here as a dog, and that\\n,is the next way to give poor jades the bots: this\\n,house is turned upside down since Robin Ostler died\\n,Poor fellow, never joyed since the price of oats\\n,rose, it was the death of him\\n,I think this be the most villanous house in all\\n,London road for fleas: I am stung like a tench\\n,Like a tench! by the mass, there is neer a king\\n,christen could be better bit than I have been since\\n,the first cock\\n,Why, they will allow us neer a jordan, and then we\\n,leak in your chimney, and your chamber-lie breeds\\n,fleas like a loach\\n,What, ostler! come away and be hanged!\\n,I have a gammon of bacon and two razors of ginger,\\n,to be delivered as far as Charing-cross\\n,Gods body! the turkeys in my pannier are quite\\n,starved What, ostler!

sure,\\n,And our induction full of prosperous hope\\n,Lord Mortimer, and cousin Glendower,\\n,Will you sit down?\\n,And uncle Worcester: a plague upon it!\\n,I have forgot the map\\n,No, here it is\\n,Sit, cousin Percy, sit, good cousin Hotspur,\\n,For by that name as oft as Lancaster\\n,Doth speak of you, his cheek looks pale and with\\n,A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven\\n,And you in hell, as oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of\\n,I cannot blame him: at my nativity\\n,The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,\\n,Of burning cressets, and at my birth\\n,The frame and huge foundation of the earth\\n,Shaked like a coward\\n,Why, so it would have done at the same season, if\\n,your mothers cat had but kittened, though yourself\\n,had never been born\\n,I say the earth did shake when I was born\\n,And I say the earth was not of my mind,\\n,If you suppose as fearing you it shook\\n,The heavens were all on fire, the earth did tremble\\n,O, then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire,\\n,And not in fear of your nativity\\n,Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth\\n,In strange eruptions, oft the teeming earth\\n,Is with a kind of colic pinchd and vexd\\n,By the imprisoning of unruly wind\\n,Within her womb, which, for enlargement striving,\\n,Shakes the old beldam earth and topples down\\n,Steeples and moss-grown towers At your birth\\n,Our grandam earth, having this distemperature,\\n,In passion shook\\n,Cousin, of many men\\n,I do not bear these crossings Give me leave\\n,To tell you once again that at my birth\\n,The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,\\n,The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds\\n,Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields\\n,These signs have markd me extraordinary,\\n,And all the courses of my life do show\\n,I am not in the roll of common men\\n,Where is he living, clippd in with the sea\\n,That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales,\\n,Which calls me pupil, or hath read to me?\\n,And bring him out that is but womans son\\n,Can trace me in the tedious ways of art\\n,And hold me pace in deep experiments\\n,I think theres no man speaks better Welsh\\n,Ill to dinner\\n,Peace, cousin Percy, you will make him mad\\n,I can call spirits from the vasty deep\\n,Why, so can I, or so can any man,\\n,But will they come when you do call for them?\\n,Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command\\n,The devil\\n,And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devil\\n,By telling truth: tell truth and shame the devil\\n,If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither,\\n,And Ill be sworn I have power to shame him hence\\n,O, while you live, tell truth and shame the devil!\\n,Come, come, no more of this unprofitable chat\\n,Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head\\n,Against my power, thrice from the banks of Wye\\n,And sandy-bottomd Severn have I sent him\\n,Bootless home and weather-beaten back\\n,Home without boots, and in foul weather too!\\n,How scapes he agues, in the devils name?\\n,Come, heres the map: shall we divide our right\\n,According to our threefold order taen?\\n,The archdeacon hath divided it\\n,Into three limits very equally:\\n,England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,\\n,By south and east is to my part assignd:\\n,All westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore,\\n,And all the fertile land within that bound,\\n,To Owen Glendower: and, dear coz, to you\\n,The remnant northward, lying off from Trent\\n,And our indentures tripartite are drawn,\\n,Which being sealed interchangeably,\\n,A business that this night may execute,\\n,To-morrow, cousin Percy, you and I\\n,And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth\\n,To meet your father and the Scottish power,\\n,As is appointed us, at Shrewsbury\\n,My father Glendower is not ready yet,\\n,Not shall we need his help these fourteen days\\n,Within that space you may have drawn together\\n,Your tenants, friends and neighbouring gentlemen\\n,A shorter time shall send me to you, lords:\\n,And in my conduct shall your ladies come,\\n,From whom you now must steal and take no leave,\\n,For there will be a world of water shed\\n,Upon the parting of your wives and you\\n,Methinks my moiety, north from Burton here,\\n,In quantity equals not one of yours:\\n,See how this river comes me cranking in,\\n,And cuts me from the best of all my land\\n,A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out\\n,Ill have the current in this place dammd up,\\n,And here the smug and silver Trent shall run\\n,In a new channel, fair and evenly,\\n,It shall not wind with such a deep indent,\\n,To rob me of so rich a bottom here\\n,Not wind? it shall, it must, you see it doth\\n,Yea, but\\n,Mark how he bears his course, and runs me up\\n,With like advantage on the other side,\\n,Gelding the opposed continent as much\\n,As on the other side it takes from you\\n,Yea, but a little charge will trench him here\\n,And on this north side win this cape of land,\\n,And then he runs straight and even\\n,Ill have it so: a little charge will do it\\n,Ill not have it alterd\\n,Will not you?\\n,No, nor you shall not\\n,Who shall say me nay?\\n,Why, that will I\\n,Let me not understand you, then, speak it in Welsh\\n,I can speak English, lord, as well as you,\\n,For I was traind up in the English court,\\n,Where, being but young, I framed to the harp\\n,Many an English ditty lovely well\\n,And gave the tongue a helpful ornament,\\n,A virtue that was never seen in you\\n,Marry,\\n,And I am glad of it with all my heart:\\n,I had rather be a kitten and cry mew\\n,Than one of these same metre ballad-mongers,\\n,I had rather hear a brazen canstick turnd,\\n,Or a dry wheel grate on the axle-tree,\\n,And that would set my teeth nothing on edge,\\n,Nothing so much as mincing poetry:\\n,Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag\\n,Come, you shall have Trent turnd\\n,I do not care: Ill give thrice so much land\\n,To any well-deserving friend,\\n,But in the way of bargain, mark ye me,\\n,Ill cavil on the ninth part of a hair\\n,Are the indentures drawn? shall we be gone?\\n,The moon shines fair, you may away by night:\\n,Ill haste the writer and withal\\n,Break with your wives of your departure hence:\\n,I am afraid my daughter will run mad,\\n,So much she doteth on her Mortimer\\n,Exit GLENDOWER\\n,Fie, cousin Percy! how you cross my father!\\n,I cannot choose: sometime he angers me\\n,With telling me of the mouldwarp and the ant,\\n,Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies,\\n,And of a dragon and a finless fish,\\n,A clip-wingd griffin and a moulten raven,\\n,A couching lion and a ramping cat,\\n,And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff\\n,As puts me from my faith I tell you what,\\n,He held me last night at least nine hours\\n,In reckoning up the several devils names\\n,That were his lackeys: I cried hum, and well, go to,\\n,But markd him not a word O, he is as tedious\\n,As a tired horse, a railing wife,\\n,Worse than a smoky house: I had rather live\\n,With cheese and garlic in a windmill, far,\\n,Than feed on cates and have him talk to me\\n,In any summer-house in Christendom\\n,In faith, he is a worthy gentleman,\\n,Exceedingly well read, and profited\\n,In strange concealments, valiant as a lion\\n,And as wondrous affable and as bountiful\\n,As mines of India Shall I tell you, cousin?\\n,He holds your temper in a high respect\\n,And curbs himself even of his natural scope\\n,When you come cross his humour, faith, he does:\\n,I warrant you, that man is not alive\\n,Might so have tempted him as you have done,\\n,Without the taste of danger and reproof:\\n,But do not use it oft, let me entreat you\\n,In faith, my lord, you are too wilful-blame,\\n,And since your coming hither have done enough\\n,To put him quite beside his patience\\n,You must needs learn, lord, to amend this fault:\\n,Though sometimes it show greatness, courage, blood,\\n,And thats the dearest grace it renders you,\\n,Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage,\\n,Defect of manners, want of government,\\n,Pride, haughtiness, opinion and disdain:\\n,The least of which haunting a nobleman\\n,Loseth mens hearts and leaves behind a stain\\n,Upon the beauty of all parts besides,\\n,Beguiling them of commendation\\n,Well, I am schoold: good manners be your speed!\\n,Here come our wives, and let us take our leave\\n,Re-enter GLENDOWER with the ladies\\n,This is the deadly spite that angers me,\\n,My wife can speak no English, I no Welsh\\n,My daughter weeps: she will not part with you,\\n,Shell be a soldier too, shell to the wars\\n,Good father, tell her that she and my aunt Percy\\n,Shall follow in your conduct speedily\\n,Glendower speaks to her in Welsh, and she answers him in the same\\n,She is desperate here, a peevish self-wind harlotry,\\n,one that no persuasion can do good upon\\n,The lady speaks in Welsh\\n,I understand thy looks: that pretty Welsh\\n,Which thou pourst down from these swelling heavens\\n,I am too perfect in, and, but for shame,\\n,In such a parley should I answer thee\\n,The lady speaks again in Welsh\\n,I understand thy kisses and thou mine,\\n,And thats a feeling disputation:\\n,But I will never be a truant, love,\\n,Till I have learned thy language, for thy tongue\\n,Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly pennd,\\n,Sung by a fair queen in a summers bower,\\n,With ravishing division, to her lute\\n,Nay, if you melt, then will she run mad\\n,The lady speaks again in Welsh\\n,O, I am ignorance itself in this!\\n,She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down\\n,And rest your gentle head upon her lap,\\n,And she will sing the song that pleaseth you\\n,And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep\\n,Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness,\\n,Making such difference twixt wake and sleep\\n,As is the difference betwixt day and night\\n,The hour before the heavenly-harnessd team\\n,Begins his golden progress in the east\\n,With all my heart Ill sit and hear her sing:\\n,By that time will our book, I think, be drawn\\n,Do so,\\n,And those musicians that shall play to you\\n,Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence,\\n,And straight they shall be here: sit, and attend\\n,Come, Kate, thou art perfect in lying down: come,\\n,quick, quick, that I may lay my head in thy lap\\n,Go, ye giddy goose\\n,The music plays\\n,Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh,\\n,And tis no marvel he is so humorous\\n,Byr lady, he is a good musician\\n,Then should you be nothing but musical for you are\\n,altogether governed by humours Lie still, ye thief,\\n,and hear the lady sing in Welsh\\n,I had rather hear Lady, my brach, howl in Irish\\n,Wouldst thou have thy head broken?\\n,No\\n,Then be still\\n,Neither,tis a womans fault\\n,Now God help thee!\\n,To the Welsh ladys bed\\n,Whats that?\\n,Peace! she sings\\n,Here the lady sings a Welsh song\\n,Come, Kate, Ill have your song too\\n,Not mine, in good sooth\\n,Not yours, in good sooth! Heart! you swear like a\\n,comfit-makers wife Not you, in good sooth, and\\n,as true as I live, and as God shall mend me, and\\n,as sure as day,\\n,And givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths,\\n,As if thou never walkst further than Finsbury\\n,Swear me, Kate, like a lady as thou art,\\n,A good mouth-filling oath, and leave in sooth,\\n,And such protest of pepper-gingerbread,\\n,To velvet-guards and Sunday-citizens\\n,Come, sing\\n,I will not sing\\n,Tis the next way to turn tailor, or be red-breast\\n,teacher An the indentures be drawn, Ill away\\n,within these two hours, and so, come in when ye will\\n,Exit\\n,Come, come, Lord Mortimer, you are as slow\\n,As hot Lord Percy is on fire to go\\n,By this our book is drawn, well but seal,\\n,And then to horse immediately\\n,With all my heart\\n,Exeunt\\n, II London The palace\\n,Enter KING HENRY IV, PRINCE HENRY, and others\\n,Lords, give us leave, the Prince of Wales and I\\n,Must have some private conference, but be near at hand,\\n,For we shall presently have need of you\\n,Exeunt Lords\\n,I know not whether God will have it so,\\n,For some displeasing service I have done,\\n,That, in his secret doom, out of my blood\\n,Hell breed revengement and a scourge for me,\\n,But thou dost in thy passages of life\\n,Make me believe that thou art only markd\\n,For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven\\n,To punish my mistreadings Tell me else,\\n,Could such inordinate and low desires,\\n,Such poor, such bare, such lewd, such mean attempts,\\n,Such barren pleasures, rude society,\\n,As thou art matchd withal and grafted to,\\n,Accompany the greatness of thy blood\\n,And hold their level with thy princely heart?\\n,So please your majesty, I would I could\\n,Quit all offences with as clear excuse\\n,As well as I am doubtless I can purge\\n,Myself of many I am charged withal:\\n,Yet such extenuation let me beg,\\n,As, in reproof of many tales devised,\\n,which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear,\\n,By smiling pick-thanks and base news-mongers,\\n,I may, for some things true, wherein my youth\\n,Hath faulty wanderd and irregular,\\n,Find pardon on my true submission\\n,God pardon thee! yet let me wonder, Harry,\\n,At thy affections, which do hold a wing\\n,Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors\\n,Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost\\n,Which by thy younger brother is supplied,\\n,And art almost an alien to the hearts\\n,Of all the court and princes of my blood:\\n,The hope and expectation of thy time\\n,Is ruind, and the soul of every man\\n,Prophetically doth forethink thy fall\\n,Had I so lavish of my presence been,\\n,So common-hackneyd in the eyes of men,\\n,So stale and cheap to vulgar company,\\n,Opinion, that did help me to the crown,\\n,Had still kept loyal to possession\\n,And left me in reputeless banishment,\\n,A fellow of no mark nor likelihood\\n,By being seldom seen, I could not stir\\n,But like a comet I was wonderd at,\\n,That men would tell their children This is he,\\n,Others would say Where, which is Bolingbroke?\\n,And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,\\n,And dressd myself in such humility\\n,That I did pluck allegiance from mens hearts,\\n,Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,\\n,Even in the presence of the crowned king\\n,Thus did I keep my person fresh and new,\\n,My presence, like a robe pontifical,\\n,Neer seen but wonderd at: and so my state,\\n,Seldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast\\n,And won by rareness such solemnity\\n,The skipping king, he ambled up and down\\n,With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,\\n,Soon kindled and soon burnt, carded his state,\\n,Mingled his royalty with capering fools,\\n,Had his great name profaned with their scorns\\n,And gave his countenance, against his name,\\n,To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push\\n,Of every beardless vain comparative,\\n,Grew a companion to the common streets,\\n,Enfeoffd himself to popularity,\\n,That, being daily swallowd by mens eyes,\\n,They surfeited with honey and began\\n,To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little\\n,More than a little is by much too much\\n,So when he had occasion to be seen,\\n,He was but as the cuckoo is in June,\\n,Heard, not regarded, seen, but with such eyes\\n,As, sick and blunted with community,\\n,Afford no extraordinary gaze,\\n,Such as is bent on sun-like majesty\\n,When it shines seldom in admiring eyes,\\n,But rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down,\\n,Slept in his face and renderd such aspect\\n,As cloudy men use to their adversaries,\\n,Being with his presence glutted, gorged and full\\n,And in that very line, Harry, standest thou,\\n,For thou has lost thy princely privilege\\n,With vile participation: not an eye\\n,But is a-weary of thy common sight,\\n,Save mine, which hath desired to see thee more,\\n,Which now doth that I would not have it do,\\n,Make blind itself with foolish tenderness\\n,I shall hereafter, my thrice gracious lord,\\n,Be more myself\\n,For all the world\\n,As thou art to this hour was Richard then\\n,When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh,\\n,And even as I was then is Percy now\\n,Now, by my sceptre and my soul to boot,\\n,He hath more worthy interest to the state\\n,Than thou the shadow of succession,\\n,For of no right, nor colour like to right,\\n,He doth fill fields with harness in the realm,\\n,Turns head against the lions armed jaws,\\n,And, being no more in debt to years than thou,\\n,Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on\\n,To bloody battles and to bruising arms\\n,What never-dying honour hath he got\\n,Against renowned Douglas! whose high deeds,\\n,Whose hot incursions and great name in arms\\n,Holds from all soldiers chief majority\\n,And military title capital\\n,Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ:\\n,Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes,\\n,This infant warrior, in his enterprises\\n,Discomfited great Douglas, taen him once,\\n,Enlarged him and made a friend of him,\\n,To fill the mouth of deep defiance up\\n,And shake the peace and safety of our throne\\n,And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland,\\n,The Archbishops grace of York, Douglas, Mortimer,\\n,Capitulate against us and are up\\n,But wherefore do I tell these news to thee?\\n,Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes,\\n,Which art my nearst and dearest enemy?\\n,Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear,\\n,Base inclination and the start of spleen\\n,To fight against me under Percys pay,\\n,To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns,\\n,To show how much thou art degenerate\\n,Do not think so, you shall not find it so:\\n,And God forgive them that so much have swayd\\n,Your majestys good thoughts away from me!\\n,I will redeem all this on Percys head\\n,And in the closing of some glorious day\\n,Be bold to tell you that I am your son,\\n,When I will wear a garment all of blood\\n,And stain my favours in a bloody mask,\\n,Which, washd away, shall scour my shame with it:\\n,And that shall be the day, wheneer it lights,\\n,That this same child of honour and renown,\\n,This gallant Hotspur, this all-praised knight,\\n,And your unthought-of Harry chance to meet\\n,For every honour sitting on his helm,\\n,Would they were multitudes, and on my head\\n,My shames redoubled! for the time will come,\\n,That I shall make this northern youth exchange\\n,His glorious deeds for my indignities\\n,Percy is but my factor, good my lord,\\n,To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf,\\n,And I will call him to so strict account,\\n,That he shall render every glory up,\\n,Yea, even the slightest worship of his time,\\n,Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart\\n,This, in the name of God, I promise here:\\n,The which if He be pleased I shall perform,\\n,I do beseech your majesty may salve\\n,The long-grown wounds of my intemperance:\\n,If not, the end of life cancels all bands,\\n,And I will die a hundred thousand deaths\\n,Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow\\n,A hundred thousand rebels die in this:\\n,Thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein\\n,Enter BLUNT\\n,How now, good Blunt? thy looks are full of speed\\n,So hath the business that I come to speak of\\n,Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word\\n,That Douglas and the English rebels met\\n,The eleventh of this month at Shrewsbury\\n,A mighty and a fearful head they are,\\n,If promises be kept on every hand,\\n,As ever offerd foul play in the state\\n,The Earl of Westmoreland set forth to-day,\\n,With him my son, Lord John of Lancaster,\\n,For this advertisement is five days old:\\n,On Wednesday next, Harry, you shall set forward,\\n,On Thursday we ourselves will march: our meeting\\n,Is Bridgenorth: and, Harry, you shall march\\n,Through Gloucestershire, by which account,\\n,Our business valued, some twelve days hence\\n,Our general forces at Bridgenorth shall meet\\n,Our hands are full of business: lets away,\\n,Advantage feeds him fat, while men delay\\n,Exeunt\\n,Eastcheap The Boars-Head Tavern\\n,Enter FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH\\n,Bardolph, am I not fallen away vilely since this last\\n,action? do I not bate? do I not dwindle? Why my\\n,skin hangs about me like an like an old ladys loose\\n,gown, I am withered like an old apple-john Well,\\n,Ill repent, and that suddenly, while I am in some\\n,liking, I shall be out of heart shortly, and then I\\n,shall have no strength to repent An I have not\\n,forgotten what the inside of a church is made of, I\\n,am a peppercorn, a brewers horse: the inside of a\\n,church!

I love him well, he is an honest man\\n,Good my lord, hear me\\n,Prithee, let her alone, and list to me\\n,What sayest thou, Jack?\\n,The other night I fell asleep here behind the arras\\n,and had my pocket picked: this house is turned\\n,bawdy-house, they pick pockets\\n,What didst thou lose, Jack?\\n,Wilt thou believe me, Hal? three or four bonds of\\n,forty pound apiece, and a seal-ring of my\\n,grandfathers\\n,A trifle, some eight-penny matter\\n,So I told him, my lord, and I said I heard your\\n,grace say so: and, my lord, he speaks most vilely\\n,of you, like a foul-mouthed man as he is, and said\\n,he would cudgel you\\n,What! he did not?\\n,Theres neither faith, truth, nor womanhood in me else\\n,Theres no more faith in thee than in a stewed\\n,prune, nor no more truth in thee than in a drawn\\n,fox, and for womanhood, Maid Marian may be the\\n,deputys wife of the ward to thee Go, you thing,\\n,go\\n,Say, what thing? what thing?\\n,What thing! why, a thing to thank God on\\n,I am no thing to thank God on, I would thou\\n,shouldst know it, I am an honest mans wife: and,\\n,setting thy knighthood aside, thou art a knave to\\n,call me so\\n,Setting thy womanhood aside, thou art a beast to say\\n,otherwise\\n,Say, what beast, thou knave, thou?\\n,What beast! why, an otter\\n,An otter, Sir John! Why an otter?\\n,Why, shes neither fish nor flesh, a man knows not\\n,where to have her\\n,Thou art an unjust man in saying so: thou or any\\n,man knows where to have me, thou knave, thou!\\n,Thou sayest true, hostess, and he slanders thee most grossly\\n,So he doth you, my lord, and said this other day you\\n,ought him a thousand pound\\n,Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?\\n,A thousand pound, Ha! a million: thy love is worth\\n,a million: thou owest me thy love\\n,Nay, my lord, he called you Jack, and said he would\\n,cudgel you\\n,Did I, Bardolph?\\n,Indeed, Sir John, you said so\\n,Yea, if he said my ring was copper\\n,I say tis copper: darest thou be as good as thy word now?\\n,Why, Hal, thou knowest, as thou art but man, I dare:\\n,but as thou art prince, I fear thee as I fear the\\n,roaring of a lions whelp\\n,And why not as the lion?\\n,The king is to be feared as the lion: dost thou\\n,think Ill fear thee as I fear thy father? nay, an\\n,I do, I pray God my girdle break\\n,O, if it should, how would thy guts fall about thy\\n,knees! But, sirrah, theres no room for faith,\\n,truth, nor honesty in this bosom of thine, it is all\\n,filled up with guts and midriff Charge an honest\\n,woman with picking thy pocket! why, thou whoreson,\\n,impudent, embossed rascal, if there were anything in\\n,thy pocket but tavern-reckonings, memorandums of\\n,bawdy-houses, and one poor penny-worth of\\n,sugar-candy to make thee long-winded, if thy pocket\\n,were enriched with any other injuries but these, I\\n,am a villain: and yet you will stand to if, you will\\n,not pocket up wrong: art thou not ashamed?\\n,Dost thou hear, Hal? thou knowest in the state of\\n,innocency Adam fell, and what should poor Jack\\n,Falstaff do in the days of villany? Thou seest I\\n,have more flesh than another man, and therefore more\\n,frailty You confess then, you picked my pocket?\\n,It appears so by the story\\n,Hostess, I forgive thee: go, make ready breakfast,\\n,love thy husband, look to thy servants, cherish thy\\n,guests: thou shalt find me tractable to any honest\\n,reason: thou seest I am pacified still Nay,\\n,prithee, be gone\\n,Exit Hostess\\n,Now Hal, to the news at court: for the robbery,\\n,lad, how is that answered?\\n,O, my sweet beef, I must still be good angel to\\n,thee: the money is paid back again\\n,O, I do not like that paying back, tis a double labour\\n,I am good friends with my father and may do any thing\\n,Rob me the exchequer the first thing thou doest, and\\n,do it with unwashed hands too\\n,Do, my lord\\n,I have procured thee, Jack, a charge of foot\\n,I would it had been of horse Where shall I find\\n,one that can steal well? O for a fine thief, of the\\n,age of two and twenty or thereabouts! I am\\n,heinously unprovided Well, God be thanked for\\n,these rebels, they offend none but the virtuous: I\\n,laud them, I praise them\\n,Bardolph!\\n,My lord?\\n,Go bear this letter to Lord John of Lancaster, to my\\n,brother John, this to my Lord of Westmoreland\\n,Exit Bardolph\\n,Go, Peto, to horse, to horse, for thou and I have\\n,thirty miles to ride yet ere dinner time\\n,Exit Peto\\n,Jack, meet me to-morrow in the temple hall at two\\n,oclock in the afternoon\\n,There shalt thou know thy charge, and there receive\\n,Money and order for their furniture\\n,The land is burning, Percy stands on high,\\n,And either we or they must lower lie\\n,Exit PRINCE HENRY\\n,Rare words! brave world! Hostess, my breakfast, come!\\n,O, I could wish this tavern were my drum!\\n,Exit\\n,\\n, I The rebel camp near Shrewsbury\\n,Enter HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, and DOUGLAS\\n,Well said, my noble Scot: if speaking truth\\n,In this fine age were not thought flattery,\\n,Such attribution should the Douglas have,\\n,As not a soldier of this seasons stamp\\n,Should go so general current through the world\\n,By God, I cannot flatter, I do defy\\n,The tongues of soothers, but a braver place\\n,In my hearts love hath no man than yourself:\\n,Nay, task me to my word, approve me, lord\\n,Thou art the king of honour:\\n,No man so potent breathes upon the ground\\n,But I will beard him\\n,Do so, and tis well\\n,Enter a Messenger with letters\\n,What letters hast thou there?I can but thank you\\n,These letters come from your father\\n,Letters from him! why comes he not himself?\\n,He cannot come, my lord, he is grievous sick\\n,Zounds! how has he the leisure to be sick\\n,In such a rustling time? Who leads his power?\\n,Under whose government come they along?\\n,His letters bear his mind, not I, my lord\\n,I prithee, tell me, doth he keep his bed?\\n,He did, my lord, four days ere I set forth,\\n,And at the time of my departure thence\\n,He was much feard by his physicians\\n,I would the state of time had first been whole\\n,Ere he by sickness had been visited:\\n,His health was never better worth than now\\n,Sick now! droop now! this sickness doth infect\\n,The very life-blood of our enterprise,\\n,Tis catching hither, even to our camp\\n,He writes me here, that inward sickness\\n,And that his friends by deputation could not\\n,So soon be drawn, nor did he think it meet\\n,To lay so dangerous and dear a trust\\n,On any soul removed but on his own\\n,Yet doth he give us bold advertisement,\\n,That with our small conjunction we should on,\\n,To see how fortune is disposed to us,\\n,For, as he writes, there is no quailing now\\n,Because the king is certainly possessd\\n,Of all our purposes What say you to it?\\n,Your fathers sickness is a maim to us\\n,A perilous gash, a very limb loppd off:\\n,And yet, in faith, it is not, his present want\\n,Seems more than we shall find it: were it good\\n,To set the exact wealth of all our states\\n,All at one cast? to set so rich a main\\n,On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour?\\n,It were not good, for therein should we read\\n,The very bottom and the soul of hope,\\n,The very list, the very utmost bound\\n,Of all our fortunes\\n,Faith, and so we should,\\n,Where now remains a sweet reversion:\\n,We may boldly spend upon the hope of what\\n,Is to come in:\\n,A comfort of retirement lives in this\\n,A rendezvous, a home to fly unto\\n,If that the devil and mischance look big\\n,Upon the maidenhead of our affairs\\n,But yet I would your father had been here\\n,The quality and hair of our attempt\\n,Brooks no division: it will be thought\\n,By some, that know not why he is away,\\n,That wisdom, loyalty and mere dislike\\n,Of our proceedings kept the earl from hence:\\n,And think how such an apprehension\\n,May turn the tide of fearful faction\\n,And breed a kind of question in our cause,\\n,For well you know we of the offering side\\n,Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement,\\n,And stop all sight-holes, every loop from whence\\n,The eye of reason may pry in upon us:\\n,This absence of your fathers draws a curtain,\\n,That shows the ignorant a kind of fear\\n,Before not dreamt of\\n,You strain too far\\n,I rather of his absence make this use:\\n,It lends a lustre and more great opinion,\\n,A larger dare to our great enterprise,\\n,Than if the earl were here, for men must think,\\n,If we without his help can make a head\\n,To push against a kingdom, with his help\\n,We shall oerturn it topsy-turvy down\\n,Yet all goes well, yet all our joints are whole\\n,As heart can think: there is not such a word\\n,Spoke of in Scotland as this term of fear\\n,Enter SIR RICHARD VERNON\\n,My cousin Vernon, welcome, by my soul\\n,Pray God my news be worth a welcome, lord\\n,The Earl of Westmoreland, seven thousand strong,\\n,Is marching hitherwards, with him Prince John\\n,No harm: what more?\\n,And further, I have learnd,\\n,The king himself in person is set forth,\\n,Or hitherwards intended speedily,\\n,With strong and mighty preparation\\n,He shall be welcome too Where is his son,\\n,The nimble-footed madcap Prince of Wales,\\n,And his comrades, that daffd the world aside,\\n,And bid it pass?\\n,All furnishd, all in arms,\\n,All plumed like estridges that with the wind\\n,Baited like eagles having lately bathed,\\n,Glittering in golden coats, like images,\\n,As full of spirit as the month of May,\\n,And gorgeous as the sun at midsummer,\\n,Wanton as youthful goats, wild as young bulls\\n,I saw young Harry, with his beaver on,\\n,His cuisses on his thighs, gallantly armd\\n,Rise from the ground like featherd Mercury,\\n,And vaulted with such ease into his seat,\\n,As if an angel droppd down from the clouds,\\n,To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus\\n,And witch the world with noble horsemanship\\n,No more, no more: worse than the sun in March,\\n,This praise doth nourish agues Let them come:\\n,They come like sacrifices in their trim,\\n,And to the fire-eyed maid of smoky war\\n,All hot and bleeding will we offer them:\\n,The mailed Mars shall on his altar sit\\n,Up to the ears in blood I am on fire\\n,To hear this rich reprisal is so nigh\\n,And yet not ours Come, let me taste my horse,\\n,Who is to bear me like a thunderbolt\\n,Against the bosom of the Prince of Wales:\\n,Harry to Harry shall, hot horse to horse,\\n,Meet and neer part till one drop down a corse\\n,O that Glendower were come!\\n,There is more news:\\n,I learnd in Worcester, as I rode along,\\n,He cannot draw his power this fourteen days\\n,Thats the worst tidings that I hear of yet\\n,Ay, by my faith, that bears a frosty sound\\n,What may the kings whole battle reach unto?\\n,To thirty thousand\\n,Forty let it be:\\n,My father and Glendower being both away,\\n,The powers of us may serve so great a day\\n,Come, let us take a muster speedily:\\n,Doomsday is near, die all, die merrily\\n,Talk not of dying: I am out of fear\\n,Of death or deaths hand for this one-half year\\n,Exeunt\\n, II A public road near Coventry\\n,Enter FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH\\n,Bardolph, get thee before to Coventry, fill me a\\n,bottle of sack: our soldiers shall march through,\\n,well to Sutton Cofil tonight\\n,Will you give me money, captain?\\n,Lay out, lay out\\n,This bottle makes an angel\\n,An if it do, take it for thy labour, and if it make\\n,twenty, take them all, Ill answer the coinage Bid\\n,my lieutenant Peto meet me at towns end\\n,I will, captain: farewell\\n,Exit\\n,If I be not ashamed of my soldiers, I am a soused\\n,gurnet I have misused the kings press damnably\\n,I have got, in exchange of a hundred and fifty\\n,soldiers, three hundred and odd pounds I press me\\n,none but good house-holders, yeomans sons, inquire\\n,me out contracted bachelors, such as had been asked\\n,twice on the banns, such a commodity of warm slaves,\\n,as had as lieve hear the devil as a drum, such as\\n,fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck\\n,fowl or a hurt wild-duck I pressed me none but such\\n,toasts-and-butter, with hearts in their bellies no\\n,bigger than pins heads, and they have bought out\\n,their services, and now my whole charge consists of\\n,ancients, corporals, lieutenants, gentlemen of\\n,companies, slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the\\n,painted cloth, where the gluttons dogs licked his\\n,sores, and such as indeed were never soldiers, but\\n,discarded unjust serving-men, younger sons to\\n,younger brothers, revolted tapsters and ostlers\\n,trade-fallen, the cankers of a calm world and a\\n,long peace, ten times more dishonourable ragged than\\n,an old faced ancient: and such have I, to fill up\\n,the rooms of them that have bought out their\\n,services, that you would think that I had a hundred\\n,and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from\\n,swine-keeping, from eating draff and husks A mad\\n,fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded\\n,all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies No eye\\n,hath seen such scarecrows Ill not march through\\n,Coventry with them, thats flat: nay, and the\\n,villains march wide betwixt the legs, as if they had\\n,gyves on, for indeed I had the most of them out of\\n,prison Theres but a shirt and a half in all my\\n,company, and the half shirt is two napkins tacked\\n,together and thrown over the shoulders like an\\n,heralds coat without sleeves, and the shirt, to say\\n,the truth, stolen from my host at Saint Albans, or\\n,the red-nose innkeeper of Daventry But thats all\\n,one, theyll find linen enough on every hedge\\n,Enter the PRINCE and WESTMORELAND\\n,How now, blown Jack! how now, quilt!\\n,What, Hal! how now, mad wag! what a devil dost thou\\n,in Warwickshire? My good Lord of Westmoreland, I\\n,cry you mercy: I thought your honour had already been\\n,at Shrewsbury\\n,Faith, Sir John,tis more than time that I were\\n,there, and you too, but my powers are there already\\n,The king, I can tell you, looks for us all: we must\\n,away all night\\n,Tut, never fear me: I am as vigilant as a cat to\\n,steal cream\\n,I think, to steal cream indeed, for thy theft hath\\n,already made thee butter But tell me, Jack, whose\\n,fellows are these that come after?\\n,Mine, Hal, mine\\n,I did never see such pitiful rascals\\n,Tut, tut, good enough to toss, food for powder, food\\n,for powder, theyll fill a pit as well as better:\\n,tush, man, mortal men, mortal men\\n,Ay, but, Sir John, methinks they are exceeding poor\\n,and bare, too beggarly\\n,Faith, for their poverty, I know not where they had\\n,that, and for their bareness, I am sure they never\\n,learned that of me\\n,No Ill be sworn, unless you call three fingers on\\n,the ribs bare But, sirrah, make haste: Percy is\\n,already in the field\\n,What, is the king encamped?\\n,He is, Sir John: I fear we shall stay too long\\n,Well,\\n,To the latter end of a fray and the beginning of a feast\\n,Fits a dull fighter and a keen guest\\n,Exeunt\\n, III The rebel camp near Shrewsbury\\n,Enter HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, DOUGLAS, and VERNON\\n,Well fight with him to-night\\n,It may not be\\n,You give him then the advantage\\n,Not a whit\\n,Why say you so? looks he not for supply?\\n,So do we\\n,His is certain, ours is doubtful\\n,Good cousin, be advised, stir not tonight\\n,Do not, my lord\\n,You do not counsel well:\\n,You speak it out of fear and cold heart\\n,Do me no slander, Douglas: by my life,\\n,And I dare well maintain it with my life,\\n,If well-respected honour bid me on,\\n,I hold as little counsel with weak fear\\n,As you, my lord, or any Scot that this day lives:\\n,Let it be seen to-morrow in the battle\\n,Which of us fears\\n,Yea, or to-night\\n,Content\\n,To-night, say I\\n,Come, come it nay not be I wonder much,\\n,Being men of such great leading as you are,\\n,That you foresee not what impediments\\n,Drag back our expedition: certain horse\\n,Of my cousin Vernons are not yet come up:\\n,Your uncle Worcesters horse came but today,\\n,And now their pride and mettle is asleep,\\n,Their courage with hard labour tame and dull,\\n,That not a horse is half the half of himself\\n,So are the horses of the enemy\\n,In general, journey-bated and brought low:\\n,The better part of ours are full of rest\\n,The number of the king exceedeth ours:\\n,For Gods sake cousin, stay till all come in\\n,The trumpet sounds a parley\\n,Enter SIR WALTER BLUNT\\n,I come with gracious offers from the king,\\n,if you vouchsafe me hearing and respect\\n,Welcome, Sir Walter Blunt, and would to God\\n,You were of our determination!\\n,Some of us love you well, and even those some\\n,Envy your great deservings and good name,\\n,Because you are not of our quality,\\n,But stand against us like an enemy\\n,And God defend but still I should stand so,\\n,So long as out of limit and true rule\\n,You stand against anointed majesty\\n,But to my charge The king hath sent to know\\n,The nature of your griefs, and whereupon\\n,You conjure from the breast of civil peace\\n,Such bold hostility, teaching his duteous land\\n,Audacious cruelty If that the king\\n,Have any way your good deserts forgot,\\n,Which he confesseth to be manifold,\\n,He bids you name your griefs, and with all speed\\n,You shall have your desires with interest\\n,And pardon absolute for yourself and these\\n,Herein misled by your suggestion\\n,The king is kind, and well we know the king\\n,Knows at what time to promise, when to pay\\n,My father and my uncle and myself\\n,Did give him that same royalty he wears,\\n,And when he was not six and twenty strong,\\n,Sick in the worlds regard, wretched and low,\\n,A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,\\n,My father gave him welcome to the shore,\\n,And when he heard him swear and vow to God\\n,He came but to be Duke of Lancaster,\\n,To sue his livery and beg his peace,\\n,With tears of innocency and terms of zeal,\\n,My father, in kind heart and pity moved,\\n,Swore him assistance and performd it too\\n,Now when the lords and barons of the realm\\n,Perceived Northumberland did lean to him,\\n,The more and less came in with cap and knee,\\n,Met him in boroughs, cities, villages,\\n,Attended him on bridges, stood in lanes,\\n,Laid gifts before him, profferd him their oaths,\\n,Gave him their heirs, as pages followd him\\n,Even at the heels in golden multitudes\\n,He presently, as greatness knows itself,\\n,Steps me a little higher than his vow\\n,Made to my father, while his blood was poor,\\n,Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh,\\n,And now, forsooth, takes on him to reform\\n,Some certain edicts and some strait decrees\\n,That lie too heavy on the commonwealth,\\n,Cries out upon abuses, seems to weep\\n,Over his countrys wrongs, and by this face,\\n,This seeming brow of justice, did he win\\n,The hearts of all that he did angle for,\\n,Proceeded further, cut me off the heads\\n,Of all the favourites that the absent king\\n,In deputation left behind him here,\\n,When he was personal in the Irish war\\n,Tut, I came not to hear this\\n,Then to the point\\n,In short time after, he deposed the king,\\n,Soon after that, deprived him of his life,\\n,And in the neck of that, taskd the whole state:\\n,To make that worse, sufferd his kinsman March,\\n,Who is, if every owner were well placed,\\n,Indeed his king, to be engaged in Wales,\\n,There without ransom to lie forfeited,\\n,Disgraced me in my happy victories,\\n,Sought to entrap me by intelligence,\\n,Rated mine uncle from the council-board,\\n,In rage dismissd my father from the court,\\n,Broke oath on oath, committed wrong on wrong,\\n,And in conclusion drove us to seek out\\n,This head of safety, and withal to pry\\n,Into his title, the which we find\\n,Too indirect for long continuance\\n,Shall I return this answer to the king?\\n,Not so, Sir Walter: well withdraw awhile\\n,Go to the king, and let there be impawnd\\n,Some surety for a safe return again,\\n,And in the morning early shall my uncle\\n,Bring him our purposes: and so farewell\\n,I would you would accept of grace and love\\n,And may be so we shall\\n,Pray God you do\\n,Exeunt\\n, IV York The ARCHBISHOPS palace\\n,Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK and SIR MICHAEL\\n,Hie, good Sir Michael, bear this sealed brief\\n,With winged haste to the lord marshal,\\n,This to my cousin Scroop, and all the rest\\n,To whom they are directed If you knew\\n,How much they do to import, you would make haste\\n,My good lord,\\n,I guess their tenor\\n,Like enough you do\\n,To-morrow, good Sir Michael, is a day\\n,Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men\\n,Must bide the touch, for, sir, at Shrewsbury,\\n,As I am truly given to understand,\\n,The king with mighty and quick-raised power\\n,Meets with Lord Harry: and, I fear, Sir Michael,\\n,What with the sickness of Northumberland,\\n,Whose power was in the first proportion,\\n,And what with Owen Glendowers absence thence,\\n,Who with them was a rated sinew too\\n,And comes not in, oer-ruled by prophecies,\\n,I fear the power of Percy is too weak\\n,To wage an instant trial with the king\\n,Why, my good lord, you need not fear,\\n,There is Douglas and Lord Mortimer\\n,No, Mortimer is not there\\n,But there is Mordake, Vernon, Lord Harry Percy,\\n,And there is my Lord of Worcester and a head\\n,Of gallant warriors, noble gentlemen\\n,And so there is: but yet the king hath drawn\\n,The special head of all the land together:\\n,The Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster,\\n,The noble Westmoreland and warlike Blunt,\\n,And moe corrivals and dear men\\n,Of estimation and command in arms\\n,Doubt not, my lord, they shall be well opposed\\n,I hope no less, yet needful tis to fear,\\n,And, to prevent the worst, Sir Michael, speed:\\n,For if Lord Percy thrive not, ere the king\\n,Dismiss his power, he means to visit us,\\n,For he hath heard of our confederacy,\\n,And tis but wisdom to make strong against him:\\n,Therefore make haste I must go write again\\n,To other friends, and so farewell, Sir Michael\\n,Exeunt\\n,ACT V\\n, I KING HENRY IVs camp near Shrewsbury\\n,Enter KING HENRY, PRINCE HENRY, Lord John of  LANCASTER, EARL OF WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT, and FALSTAFF\\n,How bloodily the sun begins to peer\\n,Above yon busky hill! the day looks pale\\n,At his distemperature\\n,The southern wind\\n,Doth play the trumpet to his purposes,\\n,And by his hollow whistling in the leaves\\n,Foretells a tempest and a blustering day\\n,Then with the losers let it sympathize,\\n,For nothing can seem foul to those that win\\n,The trumpet sounds\\n,Enter WORCESTER and VERNON\\n,How now, my Lord of Worcester! tis not well\\n,That you and I should meet upon such terms\\n,As now we meet You have deceived our trust,\\n,And made us doff our easy robes of peace,\\n,To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel:\\n,This is not well, my lord, this is not well\\n,What say you to it? will you again unknit\\n,This curlish knot of all-abhorred war?\\n,And move in that obedient orb again\\n,Where you did give a fair and natural light,\\n,And be no more an exhaled meteor,\\n,A prodigy of fear and a portent\\n,Of broached mischief to the unborn times?\\n,Hear me, my liege:\\n,For mine own part, I could be well content\\n,To entertain the lag-end of my life\\n,With quiet hours, for I do protest,\\n,I have not sought the day of this dislike\\n,You have not sought it! how comes it, then?\\n,Rebellion lay in his way, and he found it\\n,Peace, chewet, peace!\\n,It pleased your majesty to turn your looks\\n,Of favour from myself and all our house,\\n,And yet I must remember you, my lord,\\n,We were the first and dearest of your friends\\n,For you my staff of office did I break\\n,In Richards time, and posted day and night\\n,to meet you on the way, and kiss your hand,\\n,When yet you were in place and in account\\n,Nothing so strong and fortunate as I\\n,It was myself, my brother and his son,\\n,That brought you home and boldly did outdare\\n,The dangers of the time You swore to us,\\n,And you did swear that oath at Doncaster,\\n,That you did nothing purpose gainst the state,\\n,Nor claim no further than your new-falln right,\\n,The seat of Gaunt, dukedom of Lancaster:\\n,To this we swore our aid But in short space\\n,It raind down fortune showering on your head,\\n,And such a flood of greatness fell on you,\\n,What with our help, what with the absent king,\\n,What with the injuries of a wanton time,\\n,The seeming sufferances that you had borne,\\n,And the contrarious winds that held the king\\n,So long in his unlucky Irish wars\\n,That all in England did repute him dead:\\n,And from this swarm of fair advantages\\n,You took occasion to be quickly wood\\n,To gripe the general sway into your hand,\\n,Forget your oath to us at Doncaster,\\n,And being fed by us you used us so\\n,As that ungentle hull, the cuckoos bird,\\n,Useth the sparrow, did oppress our nest,\\n,Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk\\n,That even our love durst not come near your sight\\n,For fear of swallowing, but with nimble wing\\n,We were enforced, for safety sake, to fly\\n,Out of sight and raise this present head,\\n,Whereby we stand opposed by such means\\n,As you yourself have forged against yourself\\n,By unkind usage, dangerous countenance,\\n,And violation of all faith and troth\\n,Sworn to us in your younger enterprise\\n,These things indeed you have articulate,\\n,Proclaimd at market-crosses, read in churches,\\n,To face the garment of rebellion\\n,With some fine colour that may please the eye\\n,Of fickle changelings and poor discontents,\\n,Which gape and rub the elbow at the news\\n,Of hurlyburly innovation:\\n,And never yet did insurrection want\\n,Such water-colours to impaint his cause,\\n,Nor moody beggars, starving for a time\\n,Of pellmell havoc and confusion\\n,In both your armies there is many a soul\\n,Shall pay full dearly for this encounter,\\n,If once they join in trial Tell your nephew,\\n,The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world\\n,In praise of Henry Percy: by my hopes,\\n,This present enterprise set off his head,\\n,I do not think a braver gentleman,\\n,More active-valiant or more valiant-young,\\n,More daring or more bold, is now alive\\n,To grace this latter age with noble deeds\\n,For my part, I may speak it to my shame,\\n,I have a truant been to chivalry,\\n,And so I hear he doth account me too,\\n,Yet this before my fathers majesty\\n,I am content that he shall take the odds\\n,Of his great name and estimation,\\n,And will, to save the blood on either side,\\n,Try fortune with him in a single fight\\n,And, Prince of Wales, so dare we venture thee,\\n,Albeit considerations infinite\\n,Do make against it No, good Worcester, no,\\n,We love our people well, even those we love\\n,That are misled upon your cousins part,\\n,And, will they take the offer of our grace,\\n,Both he and they and you, every man\\n,Shall be my friend again and Ill be his:\\n,So tell your cousin, and bring me word\\n,What he will do: but if he will not yield,\\n,Rebuke and dread correction wait on us\\n,And they shall do their office So, be gone,\\n,We will not now be troubled with reply:\\n,We offer fair, take it advisedly\\n,Exeunt WORCESTER and VERNON\\n,It will not be accepted, on my life:\\n,The Douglas and the Hotspur both together\\n,Are confident against the world

soldiers\\n,How say you, madam? are you now persuaded\\n,That Talbot is but shadow of himself?\\n,These are his substance, sinews, arms and strength,\\n,With which he yoketh your rebellious necks,\\n,Razeth your cities and subverts your towns\\n,And in a moment makes them desolate\\n,COUNTESS\\n,Victorious Talbot! pardon my abuse:\\n,I find thou art no less than fame hath bruited\\n,And

gentlemen, what means this silence?\\n,Dare no man answer in a case of truth?\\n,Within the Temple-hall we were too loud,\\n,The garden here is more convenient\\n,RICHARD\\n,Then say at once if I maintaind the truth,\\n,Or else was wrangling Somerset in the error?\\n,Faith, I have been a truant in the law,\\n,And never yet could frame my will to it,\\n,And therefore frame the law unto my will\\n,Judge you, my Lord of Warwick, then, between us\\n,Between two hawks, which flies the higher pitch,\\n,Between two dogs, which hath the deeper mouth,\\n,Between two blades, which bears the better temper:\\n,Between two horses, which doth bear him best,\\n,Between two girls, which hath the merriest eye,\\n,I have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgement,\\n,But in these nice sharp quillets of the law,\\n,Good faith, I am no wiser than a daw\\n,RICHARD\\n,Tut, tut, here is a mannerly forbearance:\\n,The truth appears so naked on my side\\n,That any purblind eye may find it out\\n,And on my side it is so well apparelld,\\n,So clear, so shining and so evident\\n,That it will glimmer through a blind mans eye\\n,RICHARD\\n,Since you are tongue-tied and so loath to speak,\\n,In dumb significants proclaim your thoughts:\\n,Let him that is a true-born gentleman\\n,And stands upon the honour of his birth,\\n,If he suppose that I have pleaded truth,\\n,From off this brier pluck a white rose with me\\n,Let him that is no coward nor no flatterer,\\n,But dare maintain the party of the truth,\\n,Pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me\\n,I love no colours, and without all colour\\n,Of base insinuating flattery\\n,I pluck this white rose with Plantagenet\\n,I pluck this red rose with young Somerset\\n,And say withal I think he held the right\\n,Stay, lords and gentlemen, and pluck no more,\\n,Till you conclude that he upon whose side\\n,The fewest roses are croppd from the tree\\n,Shall yield the other in the right opinion\\n,Good Master Vernon, it is well objected:\\n,If I have fewest, I subscribe in silence\\n,RICHARD\\n,And I\\n,Then for the truth and plainness of the case\\n,I pluck this pale and maiden blossom here,\\n,Giving my verdict on the white rose side\\n,Prick not your finger as you pluck it off,\\n,Lest bleeding you do paint the white rose red\\n,And fall on my side so, against your will\\n,If I my lord, for my opinion bleed,\\n,Opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt\\n,And keep me on the side where still I am\\n,Well, well, come on: who else?\\n,Unless my study and my books be false,\\n,The argument you held was wrong in you:\\n,To SOMERSET\\n,In sign whereof I pluck a white rose too\\n,RICHARD\\n,Now, Somerset, where is your argument?\\n,Here in my scabbard, meditating that\\n,Shall dye your white rose in a bloody red\\n,RICHARD\\n,Meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our roses,\\n,For pale they look with fear, as witnessing\\n,The truth on our side\\n,No, Plantagenet,\\n,Tis not for fear but anger that thy cheeks\\n,Blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses,\\n,And yet thy tongue will not confess thy error\\n,RICHARD\\n,Hath not thy rose a canker, Somerset?\\n,Hath not thy rose a thorn, Plantagenet?\\n,RICHARD\\n,Ay, sharp and piercing, to maintain his truth,\\n,Whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood\\n,Well, Ill find friends to wear my bleeding roses,\\n,That shall maintain what I have said is true,\\n,Where false Plantagenet dare not be seen\\n,RICHARD\\n,Now, by this maiden blossom in my hand,\\n,I scorn thee and thy fashion, peevish boy\\n,Turn not thy scorns this way, Plantagenet\\n,RICHARD\\n,Proud Pole, I will, and scorn both him and thee\\n,Ill turn my part thereof into thy throat\\n,Away, away, good William de la Pole!\\n,We grace the yeoman by conversing with him\\n,Now, by Gods will, thou wrongst him, Somerset,\\n,His grandfather was Lionel Duke of Clarence,\\n,Third son to the third Edward King of England:\\n,Spring crestless yeomen from so deep a root?\\n,RICHARD\\n,He bears him on the places privilege,\\n,Or durst not, for his craven heart, say thus\\n,By him that made me, Ill maintain my words\\n,On any plot of ground in Christendom\\n,Was not thy father, Richard Earl of Cambridge,\\n,For treason executed in our late kings days?\\n,And, by his treason, standst not thou attainted,\\n,Corrupted, and exempt from ancient gentry?\\n,His trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood,\\n,And, till thou be restored, thou art a yeoman\\n,RICHARD\\n,My father was attached, not attainted,\\n,Condemnd to die for treason, but no traitor,\\n,And that Ill prove on better men than Somerset,\\n,Were growing time once ripend to my will\\n,For your partaker Pole and you yourself,\\n,Ill note you in my book of memory,\\n,To scourge you for this apprehension:\\n,Look to it well and say you are well warnd\\n,Ah, thou shalt find us ready for thee still,\\n,And know us by these colours for thy foes,\\n,For these my friends in spite of thee shall wear\\n,RICHARD\\n,And, by my soul, this pale and angry rose,\\n,As cognizance of my blood-drinking hate,\\n,Will I for ever and my faction wear,\\n,Until it wither with me to my grave\\n,Or flourish to the height of my degree\\n,Go forward and be choked with thy ambition!\\n,And so farewell until I meet thee next\\n,Exit\\n,Have with thee, Pole Farewell, ambitious Richard\\n,Exit\\n,RICHARD\\n,How I am braved and must perforce endure it!\\n,This blot that they object against your house\\n,Shall be wiped out in the next parliament\\n,Calld for the truce of Winchester and Gloucester,\\n,And if thou be not then created York,\\n,I will not live to be accounted Warwick\\n,Meantime, in signal of my love to thee,\\n,Against proud Somerset and William Pole,\\n,Will I upon thy party wear this rose:\\n,And here I prophesy: this brawl to-day,\\n,Grown to this faction in the Temple-garden,\\n,Shall send between the red rose and the white\\n,A thousand souls to death and deadly night\\n,RICHARD\\n,Good Master Vernon, I am bound to you,\\n,That you on my behalf would pluck a flower\\n,In your behalf still will I wear the same\\n,And so will I\\n,RICHARD\\n,Thanks, gentle sir\\n,Come, let us four to dinner: I dare say\\n,This quarrel will drink blood another day\\n,Exeunt\\n, V The Tower of London\\n,Enter MORTIMER, brought in a chair, and Gaolers\\n,Kind keepers of my weak decaying age,\\n,Let dying Mortimer here rest himself\\n,Even like a man new haled from the rack,\\n,So fare my limbs with long imprisonment\\n,And these grey locks, the pursuivants of death,\\n,Nestor-like aged in an age of care,\\n,Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer\\n,These eyes, like lamps whose wasting oil is spent,\\n,Wax dim, as drawing to their exigent,\\n,Weak shoulders, overborne with burthening grief,\\n,And pithless arms, like to a witherd vine\\n,That droops his sapless branches to the ground,\\n,Yet are these feet, whose strengthless stay is numb,\\n,Unable to support this lump of clay,\\n,Swift-winged with desire to get a grave,\\n,As witting I no other comfort have\\n,But tell me, keeper, will my nephew come?\\n,Richard Plantagenet, my lord, will come:\\n,We sent unto the Temple, unto his chamber,\\n,And answer was returnd that he will come\\n,Enough: my soul shall then be satisfied\\n,Poor gentleman! his wrong doth equal mine\\n,Since Henry Monmouth first began to reign,\\n,Before whose glory I was great in arms,\\n,This loathsome sequestration have I had:\\n,And even since then hath Richard been obscured,\\n,Deprived of honour and inheritance\\n,But now the arbitrator of despairs,\\n,Just death, kind umpire of mens miseries,\\n,With sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence:\\n,I would his troubles likewise were expired,\\n,That so he might recover what was lost\\n,Enter RICHARD PLANTAGENET\\n,My lord, your loving nephew now is come\\n,Richard Plantagenet, my friend, is he come?\\n,RICHARD\\n,Ay, noble uncle, thus ignobly used,\\n,Your nephew, late despised Richard, comes\\n,Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck,\\n,And in his bosom spend my latter gasp:\\n,O, tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks,\\n,That I may kindly give one fainting kiss\\n,And now declare, sweet stem from Yorks great stock,\\n,Why didst thou say, of late thou wert despised?\\n,RICHARD\\n,First, lean thine aged back against mine arm,\\n,And, in that ease, Ill tell thee my disease\\n,This day, in argument upon a case,\\n,Some words there grew twixt Somerset and me,\\n,Among which terms he used his lavish tongue\\n,And did upbraid me with my fathers death:\\n,Which obloquy set bars before my tongue,\\n,Else with the like I had requited him\\n,Therefore, good uncle, for my fathers sake,\\n,In honour of a true Plantagenet\\n,And for alliance sake, declare the cause\\n,My father, Earl of Cambridge, lost his head\\n,That cause, fair nephew, that imprisond me\\n,And hath detaind me all my flowering youth\\n,Within a loathsome dungeon, there to pine,\\n,Was cursed instrument of his decease\\n,RICHARD\\n,Discover more at large what cause that was,\\n,For I am ignorant and cannot guess\\n,I will, if that my fading breath permit\\n,And death approach not ere my tale be done\\n,Henry the Fourth, grandfather to this king,\\n,Deposed his nephew Richard, Edwards son,\\n,The first-begotten and the lawful heir,\\n,Of Edward king, the third of that descent:\\n,During whose reign the Percies of the north,\\n,Finding his usurpation most unjust,\\n,Endeavord my advancement to the throne:\\n,The reason moved these warlike lords to this\\n,Was, for thatyoung King Richard thus removed,\\n,Leaving no heir begotten of his body\\n,I was the next by birth and parentage,\\n,For by my mother I derived am\\n,From Lionel Duke of Clarence, the third son\\n,To King Edward the Third, whereas he\\n,From John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigree,\\n,Being but fourth of that heroic line\\n,But mark: as in this haughty attempt\\n,They laboured to plant the rightful heir,\\n,I lost my liberty and they their lives\\n,Long after this, when Henry the Fifth,\\n,Succeeding his father Bolingbroke, did reign,\\n,Thy father, Earl of Cambridge, then derived\\n,From famous Edmund Langley, Duke of York,\\n,Marrying my sister that thy mother was,\\n,Again in pity of my hard distress\\n,Levied an army, weening to redeem\\n,And have installd me in the diadem:\\n,But, as the rest, so fell that noble earl\\n,And was beheaded Thus the Mortimers,\\n,In whom the tide rested, were suppressd\\n,RICHARD\\n,Of which, my lord, your honour is the last\\n,True, and thou seest that I no issue have\\n,And that my fainting words do warrant death,\\n,Thou art my heir, the rest I wish thee gather:\\n,But yet be wary in thy studious care\\n,RICHARD\\n,Thy grave admonishments prevail with me:\\n,But yet, methinks, my fathers execution\\n,Was nothing less than bloody tyranny\\n,With silence, nephew, be thou politic:\\n,Strong-fixed is the house of Lancaster,\\n,And like a mountain, not to be removed\\n,But now thy uncle is removing hence:\\n,As princes do their courts, when they are cloyd\\n,With long continuance in a settled place\\n,RICHARD\\n,O, uncle, would some part of my young years\\n,Might but redeem the passage of your age!\\n,Thou dost then wrong me, as that slaughterer doth\\n,Which giveth many wounds when one will kill\\n,Mourn not, except thou sorrow for my good,\\n,Only give order for my funeral:\\n,And so farewell, and fair be all thy hopes\\n,And prosperous be thy life in peace and war!\\n,Dies\\n,RICHARD\\n,And peace, no war, befall thy parting soul!\\n,In prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage\\n,And like a hermit overpassd thy days\\n,Well, I will lock his counsel in my breast,\\n,And what I do imagine let that rest\\n,Keepers, convey him hence, and I myself\\n,Will see his burial better than his life\\n,Exeunt Gaolers, bearing out the body of MORTIMER\\n,Here dies the dusky torch of Mortimer,\\n,Choked with ambition of the meaner sort:\\n,And for those wrongs, those bitter injuries,\\n,Which Somerset hath offerd to my house:\\n,I doubt not but with honour to redress,\\n,And therefore haste I to the parliament,\\n,Either to be restored to my blood,\\n,Or make my ill the advantage of my good\\n,Exit\\n,I\\n, I London The Parliament-house\\n,Flourish Enter KING HENRY VI, EXETER, GLOUCESTER,  WARWICK, SOMERSET, and SUFFOLK, the BISHOP OF  WINCHESTER, RICHARD

flight,\\n,And no way canst thou turn thee for redress,\\n,But death doth front thee with apparent spoil\\n,And pale destruction meets thee in the face\\n,Ten thousand French have taen the sacrament\\n,To rive their dangerous artillery\\n,Upon no Christian soul but English Talbot\\n,Lo, there thou standst, a breathing valiant man,\\n,Of an invincible unconquerd spirit!\\n,This is the latest glory of thy praise\\n,That I, thy enemy, due thee withal,\\n,For ere the glass, that now begins to run,\\n,Finish the process of his sandy hour,\\n,These eyes, that see thee now well coloured,\\n,Shall see thee witherd, bloody, pale and dead\\n,Drum afar off\\n,Hark! hark! the Dauphins drum, a warning bell,\\n,Sings heavy music to thy timorous soul,\\n,And mine shall ring thy dire

in a pale,\\n,A little herd of Englands timorous deer,\\n,Mazed with a yelping kennel of French curs!\\n,If we be English deer, be then in blood,\\n,Not rascal-like, to fall down with a pinch,\\n,But rather, moody-mad and desperate stags,\\n,Turn on the bloody hounds with heads of steel\\n,And make the cowards stand aloof at bay:\\n,Sell every man his life as dear as mine,\\n,And they shall find dear deer of us, my friends\\n,God and Saint George, Talbot and Englands right,\\n,Prosper our colours in this dangerous fight!\\n,Exeunt\\n, III Plains in Gascony\\n,Enter a Messenger that meets YORK

I foresee with grief\\n,The utter loss of all the realm of France\\n,Be patient, York: if we conclude a peace,\\n,It shall be with such strict and severe covenants\\n,As little shall the Frenchmen

enemies\\n,CARDINAL\\n,Charles, and the rest, it is enacted thus:\\n,That, in regard King Henry gives consent,\\n,Of mere compassion and of lenity,\\n,To ease your country of distressful war,\\n,And suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace,\\n,You shall become true liegemen to his crown:\\n,And Charles, upon condition thou wilt swear\\n,To pay him tribute, submit thyself,\\n,Thou shalt be placed as viceroy under him,\\n,And still enjoy thy regal dignity\\n,Must he be then as shadow of himself?\\n,Adorn his temples with a coronet,\\n,And yet, in substance and authority,\\n,Retain but privilege of a private man?\\n,This proffer is absurd and reasonless\\n,Tis known already that I am possessd\\n,With more than half the Gallian territories,\\n,And therein reverenced for their lawful king:\\n,Shall I, for lucre of the rest unvanquishd,\\n,Detract so much from that prerogative,\\n,As to be calld but viceroy of the whole?\\n,No, lord ambassador, Ill rather keep\\n,That which I have than, coveting for more,\\n,Be cast from possibility of all\\n,Insulting Charles! hast thou by secret means\\n,Used intercession to obtain a league,\\n,And, now the matter grows to compromise,\\n,Standst thou aloof upon comparison?\\n,Either accept the title thou usurpst,\\n,Of benefit proceeding from our king\\n,And not of any challenge of desert,\\n,Or we will plague thee with incessant wars\\n,My lord, you do not well in obstinacy\\n,To cavil in the course of this contract:\\n,If once it be neglected, ten to one\\n,We shall not find like opportunity\\n,To say the truth, it is your policy\\n,To save your subjects from such massacre\\n,And ruthless slaughters as are daily seen\\n,By our proceeding in hostility,\\n,And therefore take this compact of a truce,\\n,Although you break it when your pleasure serves\\n,How sayst thou, Charles? shall our condition stand?\\n,It shall,\\n,Only reserved, you claim no interest\\n,In any of our towns of garrison\\n,Then swear

please:\\n,Hang up your ensign, let your drums be still,\\n,For here we entertain a solemn peace\\n,Exeunt\\n, V London The palace\\n,Enter SUFFOLK in conference with KING HENRY VI, GLOUCESTER and EXETER\\n,Your wondrous rare description, noble earl,\\n,Of beauteous Margaret hath astonishd me:\\n,Her virtues graced with external gifts\\n,Do breed loves settled passions in my heart:\\n,And like as rigor of tempestuous gusts\\n,Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide,\\n,So am I driven by breath of her renown\\n,Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive\\n,Where I may have fruition of her love\\n,Tush, my good lord, this superficial tale\\n,Is but a preface of her worthy praise,\\n,The chief perfections of that lovely dame\\n,Had I sufficient skill to utter them,\\n,Would make a volume of enticing lines,\\n,Able to ravish any dull conceit:\\n,And, which is more, she is not so divine,\\n,So full-replete with choice of all delights,\\n,But with as humble lowliness of mind\\n,She is content to be at your command,\\n,Command, I mean, of virtuous chaste intents,\\n,To love and honour Henry as her lord\\n,And otherwise will Henry neer presume\\n,Therefore, my lord protector, give consent\\n,That Margaret may be Englands royal queen\\n,So should I give consent to flatter sin\\n,You know, my lord, your highness is betrothd\\n,Unto another lady of esteem:\\n,How shall we then dispense with that contract,\\n,And not deface your honour with reproach?\\n,As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths,\\n,Or one that, at a triumph having vowd\\n,To try his strength, forsaketh yet the lists\\n,By reason of his adversarys odds:\\n,A poor earls daughter is unequal odds,\\n,And therefore may be broke without offence\\n,Why, what, I pray, is Margaret more than that?\\n,Her father is no better than an earl,\\n,Although in glorious titles he excel\\n,Yes, lord, her father is a king,\\n,The King of Naples and Jerusalem,\\n,And of such great authority in France\\n,As his alliance will confirm our peace\\n,And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance\\n,And so the Earl of Armagnac may do,\\n,Because he is near kinsman unto Charles\\n,Beside, his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower,\\n,Where Reignier sooner will receive than give\\n,A dower, my lords! disgrace not so your king,\\n,That he should be so abject, base and poor,\\n,To choose for wealth and not for perfect love\\n,Henry is able to enrich his queen\\n,And not seek a queen to make him rich:\\n,So worthless peasants bargain for their wives,\\n,As market-men for oxen, sheep, or horse\\n,Marriage is a matter of more worth\\n,Than to be dealt in by attorneyship,\\n,Not whom we will, but whom his grace affects,\\n,Must be companion of his nuptial bed:\\n,And therefore, lords, since he affects her most,\\n,It most of all these reasons bindeth us,\\n,In our opinions she should be preferrd\\n,For what is wedlock forced but a hell,\\n,An age of discord and continual strife?\\n,Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss,\\n,And is a pattern of celestial peace\\n,Whom should we match with Henry, being a king,\\n,But Margaret, that is daughter to a king?\\n,Her peerless feature, joined with her birth,\\n,Approves her fit for none but for a king:\\n,Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit,\\n,More than in women commonly is seen,\\n,Will answer our hope in issue of a king,\\n,For Henry, son unto a conqueror,\\n,Is likely to beget more conquerors,\\n,If with a lady of so high resolve\\n,As is fair Margaret he be linkd in love\\n,Then yield, my lords, and here conclude with me\\n,That Margaret shall be queen, and none but she\\n,Whether it be through force of your report,\\n,My noble Lord of Suffolk, or for that\\n,My tender youth was never yet attaint\\n,With any passion of inflaming love,\\n,I cannot tell, but this I am assured,\\n,I feel such sharp dissension in my breast,\\n,Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear,\\n,As I am sick with working of my thoughts\\n,Take, therefore, shipping, post, my lord, to France,\\n,Agree to any covenants, and procure\\n,That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come\\n,To cross the seas to England and be crownd\\n,King Henrys faithful and anointed queen:\\n,For your expenses and sufficient charge,\\n,Among the people gather up a tenth\\n,Be gone, I say, for, till you do return,\\n,I rest perplexed with a thousand cares\\n,And you, good uncle, banish all offence:\\n,If you do censure me by what you were,\\n,Not what you are, I know it will excuse\\n,This sudden execution of my will\\n,And so, conduct me where, from company,\\n,I may revolve and ruminate my grief\\n,Exit\\n,Ay, grief, I fear me, both at first and last\\n,Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EXETER\\n,Thus Suffolk hath prevaild, and thus he goes,\\n,As did the youthful Paris once to Greece,\\n,With hope to find the like event in love,\\n,But prosper better than the Trojan did\\n,Margaret shall now be queen, and rule the king,\\n,But I will rule both her, the king and realm\\n,Exit\\n,', '\\n, I

substance\\n,Of that great shadow I did represent,\\n,The happiest gift that ever marquess gave,\\n,The fairest queen that ever king received\\n,Suffolk, arise Welcome, Queen Margaret:\\n,I can express no kinder sign of love\\n,Than this kind kiss O Lord, that lends me life,\\n,Lend me a heart replete with thankfulness!\\n,For thou hast given me in this beauteous face\\n,A world of earthly blessings to my soul,\\n,If sympathy of love unite our thoughts\\n,Great King of England and my gracious lord,\\n,The mutual conference that my mind hath had,\\n,By day, by night, waking and in my dreams,\\n,In courtly company or at my beads,\\n,With you, mine alder-liefest sovereign,\\n,Makes me the bolder to salute my king\\n,With ruder terms, such as my wit affords\\n,And over-joy of heart

cold and summers parching heat,\\n,To conquer France, his true inheritance?\\n,And did my brother Bedford toil his wits,\\n,To keep by policy what Henry got?\\n,Have you yourselves, Somerset, Buckingham,\\n,Brave York, Salisbury, and victorious Warwick,\\n,Received deep scars in France and Normandy?\\n,Or hath mine uncle Beaufort and myself,\\n,With all the learned council of the realm,\\n,Studied so long, sat in the council-house\\n,Early and late, debating to and fro\\n,How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe,\\n,And had his highness in his infancy\\n,Crowned in Paris in despite of foes?\\n,And shall these labours and these honours die?\\n,Shall Henrys conquest, Bedfords vigilance,\\n,Your deeds of war and all our counsel die?\\n,O peers of England, shameful is this league!\\n,Fatal this marriage, cancelling your fame,\\n,Blotting your names from books of memory,\\n,Razing the characters of your renown,\\n,Defacing monuments of conquerd France,\\n,Undoing

title,\\n,Which is infallible, to Englands crown\\n,My lord, I long to hear it at full\\n,Sweet York, begin: and if thy claim be good,\\n,The Nevils are thy subjects to command\\n,Then thus:\\n,Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:\\n,The first, Edward the Black Prince, Prince of Wales,\\n,The second, William of Hatfield, and the third,\\n,Lionel Duke of Clarence: next to whom\\n,Was John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster,\\n,The fifth was Edmund Langley, Duke of York,\\n,The sixth was Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester,\\n,William of Windsor was the seventh and last\\n,Edward the Black Prince died before his father\\n,And left behind him Richard, his only son,\\n,Who after Edward the Thirds death reignd as king,\\n,Till Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster,\\n,The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt,\\n,Crownd by the name of Henry the Fourth,\\n,Seized on the realm, deposed the rightful king,\\n,Sent his poor queen to France, from whence she came,\\n,And him to Pomfret, where, as all you know,\\n,Harmless Richard was murderd traitorously\\n,Father, the duke hath told the truth:\\n,Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown\\n,Which now they hold by force and not by right,\\n,For Richard, the first sons heir, being dead,\\n,The issue of the next son should have reignd\\n,But William of Hatfield died without an heir\\n,The third son, Duke of Clarence, from whose line\\n,I claimed the crown, had issue, Philippe, a daughter,\\n,Who married Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March:\\n,Edmund had issue, Roger Earl of March,\\n,Roger had issue, Edmund, Anne and Eleanor\\n,This Edmund, in the reign of Bolingbroke,\\n,As I have read, laid claim unto the crown,\\n,And, but for Owen Glendower, had been king,\\n,Who kept him in captivity till he died\\n,But to the rest\\n,His eldest sister, Anne,\\n,My mother, being heir unto the crown\\n,Married Richard Earl of Cambridge, who was son\\n,To Edmund Langley, Edward the Thirds fifth son\\n,By her I claim the kingdom: she was heir\\n,To Roger Earl of March, who was the son\\n,Of Edmund Mortimer, who married Philippe,\\n,Sole daughter unto Lionel Duke of Clarence:\\n,So, if the issue of the elder son\\n,Succeed before the younger, I am king\\n,What plain proceeding is more plain than this?\\n,Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt,\\n,The fourth son, York claims it from the third\\n,Till Lionels issue fails, his should not reign:\\n,It fails not yet, but flourishes in thee\\n,And in thy sons, fair slips of such a stock\\n,Then, father Salisbury, kneel we together,\\n,And in this private plot be we the first\\n,That shall salute our rightful sovereign\\n,With honour of his birthright to the crown\\n,Long live our sovereign Richard, Englands king!\\n,We thank you, lords But I am not your king\\n,Till I be crownd and that my sword be staind\\n,With heart-blood of the house of Lancaster,\\n,And thats not suddenly to be performd,\\n,But with advice and silent secrecy\\n,Do you as I do in these dangerous days:\\n,Wink at the Duke of Suffolks insolence,\\n,At Beauforts pride, at Somersets ambition,\\n,At Buckingham and all the crew of them,\\n,Till they have snared the shepherd of the flock,\\n,That virtuous prince, the good Duke Humphrey:\\n,Tis that they seek, and they in seeking that\\n,Shall find their deaths, if York can prophesy\\n,My lord, break we off, we know your mind at full\\n,My heart assures me that the Earl of Warwick\\n,Shall one day make the Duke of York a king\\n,And, Nevil, this I do assure myself:\\n,Richard shall live to make the

his wont to be the hindmost man,\\n,Whateer occasion keeps him from us now\\n,Can you not see? or will ye not observe\\n,The strangeness of his alterd countenance?\\n,With what a majesty he bears himself,\\n,How insolent of late he is become,\\n,How proud, how peremptory, and unlike himself?\\n,We know the time since he was mild and affable,\\n,And if we did but glance a far-off look,\\n,Immediately he was upon his knee,\\n,That all the court admired him for submission:\\n,But meet him now, and, be it in the morn,\\n,When every one will give the time of day,\\n,He knits his brow and shows an angry eye,\\n,And passeth by with stiff unbowed knee,\\n,Disdaining duty that to us belongs\\n,Small curs are not regarded when they grin,\\n,But great men tremble when the lion roars,\\n,And Humphrey is no little man in England\\n,First note that he is near you in descent,\\n,And should you fall, he as the next will mount\\n,Me seemeth then it is no policy,\\n,Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears\\n,And his advantage following your decease,\\n,That he should come about your royal person\\n,Or be admitted to your highness council\\n,By flattery hath he won the commons hearts,\\n,And when he please to make commotion,\\n,Tis to be feard they all will follow him\\n,Now tis the spring, and weeds are shallow-rooted,\\n,Suffer them now, and theyll oergrow the garden\\n,And choke the herbs for want of husbandry\\n,The reverent care I bear unto my lord\\n,Made me collect these dangers in the duke\\n,If it be fond, call it a womans fear,\\n,Which fear if better reasons can supplant,\\n,I will subscribe and say I wrongd the duke\\n,My Lord of Suffolk, Buckingham, and York,\\n,Reprove my allegation, if you can,\\n,Or else conclude my words effectual\\n,Well hath your highness seen into this duke,\\n,And, had I first been put to speak my mind,\\n,I think I should have told your graces tale\\n,The duchess, by his subornation,\\n,Upon my life, began her devilish practises:\\n,Or, if he were not privy to those faults,\\n,Yet, by reputing of his high descent,\\n,As next the king he was successive heir,\\n,And such high vaunts of his nobility,\\n,Did instigate the bedlam brain-sick duchess\\n,By wicked means to frame our sovereigns fall\\n,Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep,\\n,And in his simple show he harbours treason\\n,The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb\\n,No, no, my sovereign, Gloucester is a man\\n,Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit\\n,Did he not, contrary to form of law,\\n,Devise strange deaths for small offences done?\\n,And did he not, in his protectorship,\\n,Levy great sums of money through the realm\\n,For soldiers pay in France, and never sent it?\\n,By means whereof the towns each day revolted\\n,Tut, these are petty faults to faults unknown\\n,Which time will bring to light in smooth\\n,Duke Humphrey\\n,My lords, at once: the care you have of us,\\n,To mow down thorns that would annoy our foot,\\n,Is worthy praise: but, shall I speak my conscience,\\n,Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent\\n,From meaning treason to our royal person\\n,As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove:\\n,The duke is virtuous, mild and too well given\\n,To dream on evil or to work my downfall\\n,Ah, whats more dangerous than this fond affiance!\\n,Seems he a dove? his feathers are but borrowed,\\n,For hes disposed as the hateful raven:\\n,Is he a lamb? his skin is surely lent him,\\n,For hes inclined as is the ravenous wolf\\n,Who cannot steal a shape that means deceit?\\n,Take

France?\\n,That all your interest in those territories\\n,Is utterly bereft you, all is lost\\n,Cold news, Lord Somerset: but Gods will be done!\\n,[Aside]  Cold news for me, for I had hope of France\\n,As firmly as I hope for fertile England\\n,Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud\\n,And caterpillars eat my leaves away,\\n,But I will remedy this gear ere long,\\n,Or sell my title for a glorious grave\\n,Enter GLOUCESTER\\n,All happiness unto my lord the king!\\n,Pardon, my liege, that I have stayd so long\\n,Nay, Gloucester, know that thou art come too soon,\\n,Unless thou wert more loyal than thou art:\\n,I do arrest thee of high treason here\\n,Well, Suffolk, thou shalt not see me blush\\n,Nor change my countenance for this arrest:\\n,A heart unspotted is not easily daunted\\n,The purest spring is not so free from mud\\n,As I am clear from treason to my sovereign:\\n,Who can accuse me? wherein am I guilty?\\n,Tis thought, my lord, that you took bribes of France,\\n,And, being protector, stayed the soldiers pay,\\n,By means whereof his highness hath lost France\\n,Is it but thought so? what are they that think it?\\n,I never robbd the soldiers of their pay,\\n,Nor ever had one penny bribe from France\\n,So help me God, as I have watchd the night,\\n,Ay, night by night, in studying good for England,\\n,That doit that eer I wrested from the king,\\n,Or any groat I hoarded to my use,\\n,Be brought against me at my trial-day!\\n,No, many a pound of mine own proper store,\\n,Because I would not tax the needy commons,\\n,Have I disbursed to the garrisons,\\n,And never askd for restitution\\n,It serves you well, my lord, to say so much\\n,I say no more than truth, so help me God!\\n,In your protectorship you did devise\\n,Strange tortures for offenders never heard of,\\n,That England was defamed by tyranny\\n,Why, tis well known that, whiles I was\\n,protector,\\n,Pity was all the fault that was in me,\\n,For I should melt at an offenders tears,\\n,And lowly words were ransom for their fault\\n,Unless it were a bloody murderer,\\n,Or foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengers,\\n,I never gave them condign punishment:\\n,Murder indeed, that bloody sin, I tortured\\n,Above the felon or what trespass else\\n,My lord, these faults are easy, quickly answered:\\n,But mightier crimes are laid unto your charge,\\n,Whereof you cannot easily purge yourself\\n,I do arrest you in his highness name,\\n,And here commit you to my lord cardinal\\n,To keep, until your further time of trial\\n,My lord of Gloucester, tis my special hope\\n,That you will clear yourself from all suspect:\\n,My conscience tells me you are innocent\\n,Ah, gracious lord, these days are dangerous:\\n,Virtue is choked with foul ambition\\n,And charity chased hence by rancours hand,\\n,Foul subornation is predominant\\n,And equity exiled your highness land\\n,I know their complot is to have my life,\\n,And if my death might make this island happy,\\n,And prove the period of their tyranny,\\n,I would expend it with all willingness:\\n,But mine is made the prologue to their play,\\n,For thousands more, that yet

slaughter-house,\\n,Even so remorseless have they borne him hence,\\n,And as the dam runs lowing up and down,\\n,Looking the way her harmless young one went,\\n,And can do nought but wail her darlings

Henry, strengthening misproud York,\\n,The common people swarm like summer flies,\\n,And whither fly the gnats but to the sun?\\n,And who shines now but Henrys enemies?\\n,O Phoebus, hadst thou never given consent\\n,That Phaethon should cheque thy fiery steeds,\\n,Thy burning car never had scorchd the earth!\\n,And, Henry, hadst thou swayd as kings should do,\\n,Or as thy father and his father did,\\n,Giving no ground unto the house of York,\\n,They never then had sprung like summer flies,\\n,I and ten thousand in this luckless realm\\n,Had left no mourning widows for our death,\\n,And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace\\n,For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air?\\n,And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity?\\n,Bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds,\\n,No way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight:\\n,The foe is merciless, and will not pity,\\n,For at their hands I have deserved no pity\\n,The air hath got into my deadly wounds,\\n,And much effuse of

though he were a king,\\n,As doth a sail, filld with a fretting gust,\\n,Command an argosy to stem the waves\\n,But think you, lords, that Clifford fled with them?\\n,No, tis impossible he should escape,\\n,For, though before his face I speak the words\\n,Your brother Richard markd him for the grave:\\n,And wheresoeer he is, hes surely dead\\n,CLIFFORD groans, and dies\\n,Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave?\\n,A deadly groan, like life and deaths departing\\n,See who it is: and, now the battles ended,\\n,If friend or foe, let him be gently used\\n,Revoke that doom of mercy, for tis Clifford,\\n,Who not contented that he loppd the branch\\n,In hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth,\\n,But set his murdering knife unto the root\\n,From whence that tender spray did sweetly spring,\\n,I mean our princely father, Duke of York\\n,From off the gates of York fetch down the head,\\n,Your fathers head, which Clifford placed there,\\n,Instead whereof let this supply the room:\\n,Measure for measure must be answered\\n,Bring forth that fatal screech-owl to our house,\\n,That nothing sung but death to us and ours:\\n,Now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound,\\n,And his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak\\n,I think his understanding is bereft\\n,Speak, Clifford, dost thou know who speaks to thee?\\n,Dark cloudy death oershades his beams of life,\\n,And he nor sees nor hears us what we say\\n,O, would he did! and so perhaps he doth:\\n,Tis but his policy to counterfeit,\\n,Because he would avoid such bitter taunts\\n,Which in the time of death he gave our father\\n,If so thou thinkst, vex him with eager words\\n,Clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace\\n,Clifford, repent in bootless penitence\\n,Clifford, devise excuses for thy faults\\n,While we devise fell tortures for thy faults\\n,Thou didst love York, and I am son to York\\n,Thou pitiedst Rutland, I will pity thee\\n,Wheres Captain Margaret, to fence you now?\\n,They mock thee, Clifford: swear as thou wast wont\\n,What, not an oath? nay, then the world goes hard\\n,When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath\\n,I know by that hes dead, and, by my soul,\\n,If this right hand would buy two hours life,\\n,That I in all despite might rail at him,\\n,This hand should chop it off, and with the\\n,issuing blood\\n,Stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst\\n,York and young Rutland could not satisfy\\n,Ay, but hes dead: off with the traitors head,\\n,And rear it in the place your fathers stands\\n,And now to London with triumphant march,\\n,There to be crowned Englands royal king:\\n,From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France,\\n,And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen:\\n,So shalt thou sinew both these lands together,\\n,And, having France thy friend, thou shalt not dread\\n,The scatterd foe that hopes to rise again,\\n,For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt,\\n,Yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears\\n,First will I see the coronation,\\n,And then to Brittany Ill cross the sea,\\n,To effect this marriage, so it please my lord\\n,Even as thou wilt, sweet Warwick, let it be,\\n,For in thy shoulder do I build my seat,\\n,And never will I undertake the thing\\n,Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting\\n,Richard, I will create thee Duke of Gloucester,\\n,And George, of Clarence: Warwick, as ourself,\\n,Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best\\n,Let me be Duke of Clarence, George of Gloucester,\\n,For Gloucesters dukedom is too ominous\\n,Tut, thats a foolish observation:\\n,Richard, be Duke of Gloucester Now to London,\\n,To see these honours in possession\\n,Exeunt\\n,I\\n, I A forest in the north of England\\n,Enter two Keepers, with cross-bows in their hands\\n,Under this thick-grown brake well

wherewith thou wast anointed:\\n,No bending knee will call thee Caesar now,\\n,No humble suitors press to speak for right,\\n,No, not a man comes for redress of thee,\\n,For how can I help them, and not myself?\\n,Ay, heres a deer whose skins a keepers fee:\\n,This is the quondam king, lets seize upon him\\n,Let me embrace thee, sour adversity,\\n,For wise men say it is the wisest course\\n,Why linger we? let us lay hands upon him\\n,Forbear awhile, well hear a little more\\n,My queen and son are gone to France for aid,\\n,And, as I hear, the great commanding Warwick\\n,Is thither gone, to crave the French kings sister\\n,To wife for Edward: if this news be true,\\n,Poor queen and son, your labour is but lost,\\n,For Warwick is a subtle orator,\\n,And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words\\n,By this account then Margaret may win him,\\n,For shes a woman to be pitied much:\\n,Her sighs will make a battery in his breast,\\n,Her tears will pierce into a marble heart,\\n,The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn,\\n,And Nero will be tainted with remorse,\\n,To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears\\n,Ay, but shes come to beg, Warwick to give,\\n,She, on his left side, craving aid for Henry,\\n,He, on his right, asking a wife for Edward\\n,She weeps, and says her Henry is deposed,\\n,He smiles, and says his Edward is installd,\\n,That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more,\\n,Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong,\\n,Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,\\n,And in conclusion wins the king from her,\\n,With promise of his sister, and what else,\\n,To strengthen and support King Edwards place\\n,O Margaret, thus twill be, and thou, poor soul,\\n,Art then forsaken, as thou wentst forlorn!\\n,Say, what art thou that talkst of kings and queens?\\n,More than I seem, and less than I was born to:\\n,A man at least, for less I should not be,\\n,And men may talk of kings, and why not I?\\n,Ay, but thou talkst as if thou wert a king\\n,Why, so I am, in mind, and thats enough\\n,But, if thou be a king, where is thy crown?\\n,My crown is in my heart, not on my head,\\n,Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,\\n,Nor to be seen: my crown is called content:\\n,A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy\\n,Well, if you be a king crownd with content,\\n,Your crown content and you must be contented\\n,To go along with us, for as we think,\\n,You are the king King Edward hath deposed,\\n,And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance\\n,Will apprehend you as his enemy\\n,But did you never swear, and break an oath?\\n,No, never such an oath, nor will not now\\n,Where did you dwell when I was King of England?\\n,Here in this country, where we now remain\\n,I was anointed king at nine months old,\\n,My father and my grandfather were kings,\\n,And you were sworn true subjects unto me:\\n,And tell me, then, have you not broke your oaths?\\n,No,\\n,For we were subjects but while you were king\\n,Why, am I dead? do I not breathe a man?\\n,Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear!\\n,Look, as I blow this feather from my face,\\n,And as the air blows it to me again,\\n,Obeying with my wind when I do blow,\\n,And yielding to another when it blows,\\n,Commanded always by the greater gust,\\n,Such is the lightness of you common men\\n,But do not break your oaths, for of that sin\\n,My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty\\n,Go where you will, the king shall be commanded,\\n,And be you kings, command, and Ill obey\\n,We are true subjects to the king, King Edward\\n,So would you be again to Henry,\\n,If

toiling desperately to find it out,\\n,Torment myself to catch the English crown:\\n,And from that torment I will free myself,\\n,Or hew my way out with a bloody axe\\n,Why, I can smile, and murder

riseth up again\\n,Fair Queen of England, worthy Margaret,\\n,Sit down with us: it ill befits thy state\\n,And birth, that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit\\n,No, mighty King of France: now Margaret\\n,Must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve\\n,Where kings command I was, I must confess,\\n,Great Albions queen in former golden days:\\n,But now mischance hath trod my title down,\\n,And with dishonour laid me on the ground,\\n,Where I must take like seat unto my fortune,\\n,And to my humble seat conform myself\\n,Why, say, fair queen, whence springs this deep despair?\\n,From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears\\n,And stops my tongue, while heart is drownd in cares\\n,Whateer it be, be thou still like thyself,\\n,And sit thee by our side:\\n,Seats her by him\\n,Yield not thy neck\\n,To fortunes yoke, but let thy dauntless mind\\n,Still ride in triumph over all mischance\\n,Be plain, Queen Margaret, and tell thy grief,\\n,It shall be eased, if France can yield relief\\n,Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts\\n,And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak\\n,Now, therefore, be it known to noble Lewis,\\n,That Henry, sole possessor of my love,\\n,Is of a king become a banishd man,\\n,And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn,\\n,While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York\\n,Usurps the regal title and the seat\\n,Of Englands true-anointed lawful king\\n,This is the cause that I, poor Margaret,\\n,With this my son, Prince Edward, Henrys heir,\\n,Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid,\\n,And if thou fail us, all our hope is done:\\n,Scotland hath will to help, but cannot help,\\n,Our people and our peers are both misled,\\n,Our treasures seized, our soldiers put to flight,\\n,And, as thou seest, ourselves in heavy plight\\n,Renowned queen, with patience calm the storm,\\n,While we bethink a means to break it off\\n,The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe\\n,The more I stay, the more Ill succor thee\\n,O, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow\\n,And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow!\\n,Enter WARWICK\\n,Whats he approacheth boldly to our presence?\\n,Our Earl of Warwick, Edwards greatest friend\\n,Welcome, brave Warwick! What brings thee to France?\\n,He descends She ariseth\\n,Ay, now begins a second storm to rise,\\n,For this is he that moves both wind and tide\\n,From worthy Edward, King of Albion,\\n,My lord and sovereign, and thy vowed friend,\\n,I come, in kindness and unfeigned love,\\n,First, to do greetings to thy royal person,\\n,And then to crave a league of amity,\\n,And lastly, to confirm that amity\\n,With a nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grant\\n,That virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sister,\\n,To Englands king in lawful marriage\\n,[Aside]  If that go forward, Henrys hope is done\\n,[To BONA]  And, gracious madam, in our kings behalf,\\n,I am commanded, with your leave and favour,\\n,Humbly to kiss your hand, and with my tongue\\n,To tell the passion of my sovereigns heart,\\n,Where fame, late entering at his heedful ears,\\n,Hath placed thy beautys image and thy virtue\\n,King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak,\\n,Before you answer Warwick His demand\\n,Springs not from Edwards well-meant honest love,\\n,But from deceit bred by necessity,\\n,For how can tyrants safely govern home,\\n,Unless abroad they purchase great alliance?\\n,To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice,\\n,That Henry liveth still: but were he dead,\\n,Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henrys son\\n,Look, therefore, Lewis, that by this league and marriage\\n,Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour,\\n,For though usurpers sway the rule awhile,\\n,Yet heavens are just, and time suppresseth wrongs\\n,Injurious Margaret!\\n,And why not queen?\\n,Because thy father Henry did usurp,\\n,And thou no more are prince than she is queen\\n,Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,\\n,Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain,\\n,And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,\\n,Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest,\\n,And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,\\n,Who by his prowess conquered all France:\\n,From these our Henry lineally descends\\n,Oxford, how haps it, in this smooth discourse,\\n,You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost\\n,All that which Henry Fifth had gotten?\\n,Methinks these peers of France should smile at that\\n,But for the rest, you tell a pedigree\\n,Of threescore and two years, a silly time\\n,To make prescription for a kingdoms worth\\n,Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,\\n,Whom thou obeyedst thirty and six years,\\n,And not bewray thy treason with a blush?\\n,Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right,\\n,Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree?\\n,For shame! leave Henry, and call Edward king\\n,Call him my king by whose injurious doom\\n,My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere,\\n,Was done to death? and more than so, my father,\\n,Even in the downfall of his mellowd years,\\n,When nature brought him to the door of death?\\n,No, Warwick, no, while life upholds this arm,\\n,This arm upholds the house of Lancaster\\n,And I the house of York\\n,Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,\\n,Vouchsafe, at our request, to stand aside,\\n,While I use further conference with Warwick\\n,They stand aloof\\n,Heavens grant that Warwicks words bewitch him not!\\n,Now Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,\\n,Is Edward your true king? for I were loath\\n,To link with him that were not lawful chosen\\n,Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour\\n,But is he gracious in the peoples eye?\\n,The more that Henry was unfortunate\\n,Then further, all dissembling set aside,\\n,Tell me for truth the measure of his love\\n,Unto our sister Bona\\n,Such it seems\\n,As may beseem a monarch like himself\\n,Myself have often heard him say and swear\\n,That this his love was an eternal plant,\\n,Whereof the root was fixd in virtues ground,\\n,The leaves and fruit maintaind with beautys sun,\\n,Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,\\n,Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain\\n,Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve\\n,Your grant, or your denial, shall be mine:\\n,To WARWICK\\n,Yet I confess that often ere this day,\\n,When I have heard your kings desert recounted,\\n,Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire\\n,Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edwards,\\n,And now forthwith shall articles be drawn\\n,Touching the jointure that your king must make,\\n,Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised\\n,Draw near, Queen Margaret, and be a witness\\n,That Bona shall be wife to the English king\\n,To Edward, but not to the English king\\n,Deceitful Warwick! it was thy device\\n,By this alliance to make void my suit:\\n,Before thy coming Lewis was Henrys friend\\n,And still is friend to him and Margaret:\\n,But if your title to the crown be weak,\\n,As may appear by Edwards good success,\\n,Then tis but reason that I be released\\n,From giving aid which late I promised\\n,Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand\\n,That your estate requires and mine can yield\\n,Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease,\\n,Where having nothing, nothing can he lose\\n,And as for you yourself, our quondam queen,\\n,You have a father able to maintain you,\\n,And better twere you troubled him than France\\n,Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick, peace,\\n,Proud setter up and puller down of kings!\\n,I will not hence, till, with my talk and tears,\\n,Both full of truth, I make King Lewis behold\\n,Thy sly conveyance and thy lords false love,\\n,For both of you are birds of selfsame feather\\n,Post blows a horn within\\n,Warwick, this is some post to us or thee\\n,Enter a Post\\n,[To WARWICK]  My lord ambassador, these letters are for you,\\n,Sent from your brother, Marquess Montague:\\n,To KING LEWIS XI\\n,These from our king unto your majesty:\\n,To QUEEN MARGARET\\n,And, madam, these for you, from whom I know not\\n,They all read their letters\\n,I like it well that our fair queen and mistress\\n,Smiles at her news, while Warwick frowns at his\\n,Nay, mark how Lewis stamps, as he were nettled:\\n,I hope alls for the best\\n,Warwick, what are thy news? and yours, fair queen?\\n,Mine, such as fill my heart with unhoped joys\\n,Mine, full of sorrow and hearts discontent\\n,What! has your king married the Lady Grey!\\n,And now, to soothe your forgery and his,\\n,Sends me a paper to persuade me patience?\\n,Is this the alliance that he seeks with France?\\n,Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner?\\n,I told your majesty as much before:\\n,This proveth Edwards love and Warwicks honesty\\n,King Lewis, I here protest, in sight of heaven,\\n,And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss,\\n,That I am clear from this misdeed of Edwards,\\n,No more my king, for he dishonours me,\\n,But most himself, if he could see his shame\\n,Did I forget that by the house of York\\n,My father came untimely to his death?\\n,Did I let pass the abuse done to my niece?\\n,Did I impale him with the regal crown?\\n,Did I put Henry from his native right?\\n,And am I guerdond at the last with shame?\\n,Shame on himself! for my desert is honour:\\n,And to repair my honour lost for him,\\n,I here renounce him and return to Henry\\n,My noble queen, let former grudges pass,\\n,And henceforth I am thy true servitor:\\n,I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona,\\n,And replant Henry in his former state\\n,Warwick, these words have turnd my hate to love,\\n,And I forgive and quite forget old faults,\\n,And joy that thou becomest King Henrys friend\\n,So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,\\n,That, if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us\\n,With some few bands of chosen soldiers,\\n,Ill undertake to land them on our coast\\n,And force the tyrant from his seat by war\\n,Tis not his new-made bride shall succor him:\\n,And as for Clarence, as my letters tell me,\\n,Hes very likely now to fall from him,\\n,For matching more for wanton lust than honour,\\n,Or than for strength and safety of our country\\n,Dear brother, how shall Bona be revenged\\n,But by thy help to this distressed queen?\\n,Renowned prince, how shall poor Henry live,\\n,Unless thou rescue him from foul despair?\\n,My quarrel and this English queens are one\\n,And mine, fair lady Bona, joins with yours\\n,And mine with hers, and thine, and Margarets\\n,Therefore at last I firmly am resolved\\n,You shall have aid\\n,Let me give humble thanks for all at once\\n,Then, Englands messenger, return in post,\\n,And tell false Edward, thy supposed king,\\n,That Lewis of France is sending over masquers\\n,To revel it with him and his new bride:\\n,Thou seest whats past, go fear thy king withal\\n,Tell him, in hope hell prove a widower shortly,\\n,Ill wear the willow garland for his sake\\n,Tell him, my mourning weeds are laid aside,\\n,And I am ready to put armour on\\n,Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,\\n,And therefore Ill uncrown him eret be long\\n,Theres thy reward: be gone\\n,Exit Post\\n,But, Warwick,\\n,Thou and Oxford, with five thousand men,\\n,Shall cross the seas, and bid false Edward battle,\\n,And, as occasion serves, this noble queen\\n,And prince shall follow with a fresh supply\\n,Yet, ere thou go, but answer me one doubt,\\n,What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty?\\n,This shall assure my constant loyalty,\\n,That if our queen and this young prince agree,\\n,Ill join mine eldest daughter and my joy\\n,To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands\\n,Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motion\\n,Son Edward, she is fair and virtuous,\\n,Therefore delay not, give thy hand to Warwick,\\n,And, with thy hand, thy faith irrevocable,\\n,That only Warwicks daughter shall be thine\\n,Yes, I accept her, for she well deserves it,\\n,And here, to pledge my vow, I give my hand\\n,He gives his hand to WARWICK\\n,Why stay we now?

but it is\\n,not to be recovered\\n,It might have been recovered\\n,It might, but it is not now\\n,It is to be recovered: but that the merit of\\n,service is seldom attributed to the true and exact\\n,performer, I would have that drum or another, or\\n,hic jacet\\n,Why, if you have a stomach, tot, monsieur: if you\\n,think your mystery in stratagem can bring this\\n,instrument of honour again into his native quarter,\\n,be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on, I will\\n,grace the attempt for a worthy exploit: if you\\n,speed well in it, the duke shall both speak of it\\n,and extend to you what further becomes his\\n,greatness, even to the utmost syllable of your\\n,worthiness\\n,By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it\\n,But you must not now slumber in it\\n,Ill about it this evening: and I will presently\\n,pen down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my\\n,certainty, put myself into my mortal preparation,\\n,and by midnight look to hear further from me\\n,May I be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it?\\n,I know not what the success will be, my lord, but\\n,the attempt I vow\\n,I know thourt valiant, and, to the possibility of\\n,thy soldiership, will subscribe for thee Farewell\\n,I love not many words\\n,Exit\\n,No more than a fish loves water Is not this a\\n,strange fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems\\n,to undertake this business, which he knows is not to\\n,be done, damns himself to do and dares better be\\n,damned than to dot?\\n,You do not know him, my lord, as we do: certain it\\n,is that he will steal himself into a mans favour and\\n,for a week escape a great deal of discoveries, but\\n,when you find him out, you have him ever after\\n,Why, do you think he will make no deed at all of\\n,this that so seriously he does address himself unto?\\n,None in the world, but return with an invention and\\n,clap upon you two or three probable lies: but we\\n,have almost embossed him, you shall see his fall\\n,to-night, for indeed he is not for your lordships respect\\n,Well make you some sport with the fox ere we case\\n,him He was first smoked by the old lord Lafeu:\\n,when his disguise and he is parted, tell me what a\\n,sprat you shall find him, which you shall see this\\n,very night\\n,I must go look my twigs: he shall be caught\\n,Your brother he shall go along with me\\n,Ast please your lordship: Ill leave you\\n,Exit\\n,Now will I lead you to the house, and show you\\n,The lass I spoke of\\n,But you say shes honest\\n,Thats all the fault: I spoke with her but once\\n,And found her wondrous cold, but I sent to her,\\n,By this same coxcomb that we have i the wind,\\n,Tokens and letters which she did re-send,\\n,And this is all I have done Shes a fair creature:\\n,Will you go see her?\\n,With all my heart, my lord\\n,Exeunt\\n, VII Florence The Widows house\\n,Enter HELENA and Widow\\n,If you misdoubt me that I am not she,\\n,I know not how I shall assure you further,\\n,But I shall lose the grounds I work upon\\n,Though my estate be fallen, I was well born,\\n,Nothing acquainted with these businesses,\\n,And would not put my reputation now\\n,In any staining act\\n,Nor would I wish you\\n,First, give me trust, the count he is my husband,\\n,And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken\\n,Is so from word to word, and then you cannot,\\n,By the good aid that I of you shall borrow,\\n,Err in bestowing it\\n,I should believe you:\\n,For you have showd me that which well approves\\n,Youre great in fortune\\n,Take this purse of gold,\\n,And let me buy your friendly help thus far,\\n,Which I will over-pay and pay again\\n,When I have found it The count he wooes your daughter,\\n,Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty,\\n,Resolved to carry her: let her in fine consent,\\n,As well direct her how tis best to bear it\\n,Now his important blood will nought deny\\n,That shell demand: a ring the county wears,\\n,That downward hath succeeded in his house\\n,From son to son, some four or five descents\\n,Since the first father wore it: this ring he holds\\n,In most rich choice, yet in his idle fire,\\n,To buy his will, it would not seem too dear,\\n,Howeer repented after\\n,Now I see\\n,The bottom of your purpose\\n,You see it lawful, then: it is no more,\\n,But that your daughter, ere she seems as won,\\n,Desires this ring, appoints him an encounter,\\n,In fine, delivers me to fill the time,\\n,Herself most chastely absent: after this,\\n,To marry her, Ill add three thousand crowns\\n,To what is passed already\\n,I have yielded:\\n,Instruct my daughter how she shall persever,\\n,That time and place with this deceit so lawful\\n,May prove coherent Every night he comes\\n,With musics of all sorts and songs composed\\n,To her unworthiness: it nothing steads us\\n,To chide him from our eaves, for he persists\\n,As if his life lay ont\\n,Why then to-night\\n,Let us assay our plot, which, if it speed,\\n,Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed\\n,And lawful meaning in a lawful act,\\n,Where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact:\\n,But lets about it\\n,Exeunt\\n,\\n, I Without the Florentine camp\\n,Enter Second French Lord, with five or six other Soldiers in ambush\\n,He can come no other way but by this hedge-corner\\n,When you sally upon him, speak what terrible\\n,language you will: though you

shall I say I have\\n,done? It must be a very plausive invention that\\n,carries it: they begin to smoke me, and disgraces\\n,have of late knocked too often at my door I find\\n,my tongue is too foolhardy, but my heart hath the\\n,fear of Mars before it and of his creatures, not\\n,daring the reports of my tongue\\n,This is the first truth that eer thine own tongue\\n,was guilty of\\n,What the devil should move me to undertake the\\n,recovery of this drum, being not ignorant of the\\n,impossibility, and knowing I had no such purpose? I\\n,must give myself some hurts, and say I got them in\\n,exploit: yet slight ones will not carry it, they\\n,will say, Came you off with so little? and great\\n,ones I dare not give Wherefore, whats the\\n,instance?

This has no holding,\\n,To swear by him whom I protest to love,\\n,That I will work against him: therefore your oaths\\n,Are words and poor conditions, but unseald,\\n,At least in my opinion\\n,Change it, change it,\\n,Be not so holy-cruel: love is holy,\\n,And my integrity neer knew the crafts\\n,That you do charge men with Stand no more off,\\n,But give thyself unto my sick desires,\\n,Who then recover: say thou art mine, and ever\\n,My love as it begins shall so persever\\n,I see that men make ropes in such a scarre\\n,That well forsake ourselves Give me that ring\\n,Ill lend it thee, my dear, but have no power\\n,To give it from me\\n,Will you not, my lord?\\n,It is an honour longing to our house,\\n,Bequeathed down from many ancestors,\\n,Which were the greatest obloquy i the world\\n,In me to lose\\n,Mine honours such a ring:\\n,My chastitys the jewel of our house,\\n,Bequeathed down from many ancestors,\\n,Which were the greatest obloquy i the world\\n,In me to lose: thus your own proper wisdom\\n,Brings in the champion Honour on my part,\\n,Against your vain assault\\n,Here, take my ring:\\n,My house, mine honour, yea, my life, be thine,\\n,And Ill be bid by thee\\n,When midnight comes, knock at my chamber-window:\\n,Ill order take my mother shall not hear\\n,Now will I charge you in the band of truth,\\n,When you have conquerd my yet maiden bed,\\n,Remain there but an hour, nor speak to me:\\n,My reasons are most strong, and you shall know them\\n,When back again this ring shall be deliverd:\\n,And on your finger in the night Ill put\\n,Another ring, that what in time proceeds\\n,May token to the future our past deeds\\n,Adieu, till then, then, fail not You have won\\n,A wife of me, though there my hope be done\\n,A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee\\n,Exit\\n,For which live long to thank both heaven and me!\\n,You may so in the end\\n,My mother told me just how he would woo,\\n,As if she sat in s heart, she says all men\\n,Have the like oaths: he had sworn to marry me\\n,When his wifes dead, therefore Ill lie with him\\n,When I am buried Since Frenchmen are so braid,\\n,Marry that will, I live and die a maid:\\n,Only in this disguise I thinkt no sin\\n,To cozen him that would unjustly win\\n,Exit\\n, III The Florentine camp\\n,Enter the two French Lords and some two or three Soldiers\\n,You have not given him his mothers letter?\\n,I have delivered it an hour since: there is\\n,something int that stings his nature, for on the\\n,reading it he changed almost into another man\\n,He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking\\n,off so good a wife and so sweet a lady\\n,Especially he hath incurred the everlasting\\n,displeasure of the king, who had even tuned his\\n,bounty to sing happiness to him I will tell you a\\n,thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you\\n,When you have spoken it, tis dead, and I am the\\n,grave of it\\n,He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in\\n,Florence, of a most chaste renown, and this night he\\n,fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour: he hath\\n,given her his monumental ring, and thinks himself\\n,made in the unchaste composition\\n,Now, God delay our rebellion! as we are ourselves,\\n,what things are we!\\n,Merely our own traitors And as in the common course\\n,of all treasons, we still see them reveal\\n,themselves, till they attain to their abhorred ends,\\n,so he that in this action contrives against his own\\n,nobility, in his proper stream oerflows himself\\n,Is it not meant damnable in us, to be trumpeters of\\n,our unlawful intents? We shall not then have his\\n,company to-night?\\n,Not till after midnight, for he is dieted to his hour\\n,That approaches apace, I would gladly have him see\\n,his company anatomized, that he might take a measure\\n,of his own judgments, wherein so curiously he had\\n,set this counterfeit\\n,We will not meddle with him till he come, for his\\n,presence must be the whip of the other\\n,In the mean time, what hear you of these wars?\\n,I hear there is an overture of peace\\n,Nay, I assure you, a peace concluded\\n,What will Count Rousillon do then? will he travel\\n,higher, or return again into France?\\n,I perceive, by this demand, you are not altogether\\n,of his council\\n,Let it be forbid, sir, so should I be a great deal\\n,of his act\\n,Sir, his wife some two months since fled from his\\n,house: her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques\\n,le Grand, which holy undertaking with most austere\\n,sanctimony she accomplished, and, there residing the\\n,tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her\\n,grief, in fine, made a groan of her last breath, and\\n,now she sings in heaven\\n,How is this justified?\\n,The stronger part of it by her own letters, which\\n,makes her story true, even to the point of her\\n,death: her death itself, which could not be her\\n,office to say is come, was faithfully confirmed by\\n,the rector of the place\\n,Hath the count all this intelligence?\\n,Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from\\n,point, so to the full arming of the verity\\n,I am heartily sorry that hell be glad of this\\n,How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses!\\n,And how mightily some other times we drown our gain\\n,in tears! The great dignity that his valour hath\\n,here acquired for him shall at home be encountered\\n,with a shame as ample\\n,The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and\\n,ill together: our virtues would be proud, if our\\n,faults whipped them not, and our crimes would\\n,despair, if they were not cherished by our virtues\\n,Enter a Messenger\\n,How now! wheres your master?\\n,He met the duke in the street, sir, of whom he hath\\n,taken a solemn leave: his lordship will next\\n,morning for France The duke hath offered him\\n,letters of commendations to the king\\n,They shall be no more than needful there, if they\\n,were more than they can commend\\n,They cannot be too sweet for the kings tartness\\n,Heres his lordship now\\n,Enter BERTRAM\\n,How now, my lord! ist not after midnight?\\n,I have to-night dispatched sixteen businesses, a\\n,months length a-piece, by an abstract of success:\\n,I have congied with the duke, done my adieu with his\\n,nearest, buried a wife, mourned for her, writ to my\\n,lady mother I am returning, entertained my convoy,\\n,and between these main parcels of dispatch effected\\n,many nicer needs, the last was the greatest, but\\n,that I have not ended yet\\n,If the business be of any difficulty, and this\\n,morning your departure hence, it requires haste of\\n,your lordship\\n,I mean, the business is not ended, as fearing to\\n,hear of it hereafter But shall we have this\\n,dialogue between the fool and the soldier?

Your reason\\n,Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never sawest\\n,good manners, if thou never sawest good manners,\\n,then thy manners must be wicked, and wickedness is\\n,sin, and sin is damnation Thou art in a parlous\\n,state, shepherd\\n,Not a whit, Touchstone: those that are good manners\\n,at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the\\n,behavior of the country is most mockable at the\\n,court You told me you salute not at the court, but\\n,you kiss your hands: that courtesy would be\\n,uncleanly, if courtiers were shepherds\\n,Instance, briefly, come, instance\\n,Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their\\n,fells, you know, are greasy\\n,Why, do not your courtiers hands sweat? and is not\\n,the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of\\n,a man? Shallow, shallow A better instance, I say, come\\n,Besides, our hands are hard\\n,Your lips will feel them the sooner Shallow again\\n,A more sounder instance, come\\n,And they are often tarred over with the surgery of\\n,our sheep: and would you have us kiss tar? The\\n,courtiers hands are perfumed with civet\\n,Most shallow man! thou worms-meat, in respect of a\\n,good piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and\\n,perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar, the\\n,very uncleanly flux of a cat Mend the instance, shepherd\\n,You have too courtly a wit for me: Ill rest\\n,Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee, shallow man!\\n,God make incision in thee! thou art raw\\n,Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get\\n,that I wear, owe no man hate, envy no mans\\n,happiness, glad of other mens good, content with my\\n,harm, and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes\\n,graze and my lambs suck\\n,That is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes\\n,and the rams together and to offer to get your\\n,living by the copulation of cattle, to be bawd to a\\n,bell-wether, and to betray a she-lamb of a\\n,twelvemonth to a crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram,\\n,out of all reasonable match If thou beest not\\n,damned for this, the devil himself will have no\\n,shepherds, I cannot see else how thou shouldst\\n,scape\\n,Here comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistresss brother\\n,Enter ROSALIND, with a paper, reading\\n,From the east to western Ind,\\n,No jewel is like Rosalind\\n,Her worth, being mounted on the wind,\\n,Through all the world bears Rosalind\\n,All the pictures fairest lined\\n,Are but black to Rosalind\\n,Let no fair be kept in mind\\n,But the fair of Rosalind\\n,Ill rhyme you so eight years together, dinners and\\n,suppers and sleeping-hours excepted: it is the\\n,right butter-womens rank to market\\n,Out, fool!\\n,For a taste:\\n,If a hart do lack a hind,\\n,Let him seek out Rosalind\\n,If the cat will after kind,\\n,So be sure will Rosalind\\n,Winter garments must be lined,\\n,So must slender Rosalind\\n,They that reap must sheaf and bind,\\n,Then to cart with Rosalind\\n,Sweetest nut hath sourest rind,\\n,Such a nut is Rosalind\\n,He that sweetest rose will find\\n,Must find loves prick and Rosalind\\n,This is the very false gallop of verses: why do you\\n,infect yourself with them?\\n,Peace, you dull fool! I found them on a tree\\n,Truly, the tree yields bad fruit\\n,Ill graff it with you, and then I shall graff it\\n,with a medlar: then it will be the earliest fruit\\n,i the country, for youll be rotten ere you be half\\n,ripe, and thats the right virtue of the medlar\\n,You have said, but whether wisely or no, let the\\n,forest judge\\n,Enter CELIA, with a writing\\n,Peace! Here comes my sister, reading: stand aside\\n,[Reads]\\n,Why should this a desert be?\\n,For it is unpeopled? No:\\n,Tongues Ill hang on every tree,\\n,That shall civil sayings show:\\n,Some, how brief the life of man\\n,Runs his erring pilgrimage,\\n,That the stretching of a span\\n,Buckles in his sum of age,\\n,Some, of violated vows\\n,Twixt the souls of friend and friend:\\n,But upon the fairest boughs,\\n,Or at every sentence end,\\n,Will I Rosalinda write,\\n,Teaching all that read to know\\n,The quintessence of every sprite\\n,Heaven would in little show\\n,Therefore Heaven Nature charged\\n,That one body should be filld\\n,With all graces wide-enlarged:\\n,Nature presently distilld\\n,Helens cheek, but not her heart,\\n,Cleopatras majesty,\\n,Atalantas better part,\\n,Sad Lucretias modesty\\n,Thus Rosalind of many parts\\n,By heavenly synod was devised,\\n,Of many faces, eyes and hearts,\\n,To have the touches dearest prized\\n,Heaven would that she these gifts should have,\\n,And I to live and die her slave\\n,O most gentle pulpiter! what tedious homily of love\\n,have you wearied your parishioners withal, and never\\n,cried Have patience, good people!\\n,How now! back, friends! Shepherd, go off a little\\n,Go with him, sirrah\\n,Come, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat,\\n,though not with bag and baggage, yet with scrip and scrippage\\n,Exeunt CORIN and TOUCHSTONE\\n,Didst thou hear these verses?\\n,O, yes, I heard them all, and more too, for some of\\n,them had in them more feet than the verses would bear\\n,Thats no matter: the feet might bear the verses\\n,Ay, but the feet were lame and could not bear\\n,themselves without the verse and therefore stood\\n,lamely in the verse\\n,But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name\\n,should be hanged and carved upon these trees?\\n,I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder\\n,before you came, for look here what I found on a\\n,palm-tree I was never so be-rhymed since\\n,Pythagoras time, that I was an Irish rat, which I\\n,can hardly remember\\n,Trow you who hath done this?\\n,Is it a man?\\n,And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck\\n,Change you colour?\\n,I prithee, who?\\n,O Lord, Lord! it is a hard matter for friends to\\n,meet, but mountains may be removed with earthquakes\\n,and so encounter\\n,Nay, but who is it?\\n,Is it possible?\\n,Nay, I prithee now with most petitionary vehemence,\\n,tell me who it is\\n,O wonderful, wonderful, and most wonderful\\n,wonderful! and yet again wonderful, and after that,\\n,out of all hooping!\\n,Good my complexion! dost thou think, though I am\\n,caparisoned like a man, I have a doublet and hose in\\n,my disposition? One inch of delay more is a\\n,South-sea of discovery, I prithee, tell me who is it\\n,quickly, and speak apace I would thou couldst\\n,stammer, that thou mightst pour this concealed man\\n,out of thy mouth, as wine comes out of a narrow-\\n,mouthed bottle, either too much at once, or none at\\n,all I prithee, take the cork out of thy mouth that\\n,may drink thy tidings\\n,So you may put a man in your belly\\n,Is he of Gods making? What manner of man? Is his\\n,head worth a hat, or his chin worth a beard?\\n,Nay, he hath but a little beard\\n,Why, God will send more, if the man will be\\n,thankful: let me stay the growth of his beard, if\\n,thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin\\n,It is young Orlando, that tripped up the wrestlers\\n,heels and your heart both in an instant\\n,Nay, but the devil take mocking: speak, sad brow and\\n,true maid\\n,I faith, coz, tis he\\n,Orlando?\\n,Orlando\\n,Alas the day! what shall I do with my doublet and\\n,hose? What did he when thou sawest him? What said\\n,he? How looked he? Wherein went he? What makes\\n,him here? Did he ask for me? Where remains he?\\n,How parted he with thee? and when shalt thou see\\n,him again? Answer me in one word\\n,You must borrow me Gargantuas mouth first: tis a\\n,word too great for any mouth of this ages size To\\n,say ay and no to these particulars is more than to\\n,answer in a catechism\\n,But doth he know that I am in this forest and in\\n,mans apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the\\n,day he wrestled?\\n,It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the\\n,propositions of a lover, but take a taste of my\\n,finding him, and relish it with good observance\\n,I found him under a tree, like a dropped acorn\\n,It may well be called Joves tree, when it drops\\n,forth such fruit\\n,Give me audience, good madam\\n,Proceed\\n,There lay he, stretched along, like a wounded knight\\n,Though it be pity to see such a sight, it well\\n,becomes the ground\\n,Cry holla to thy tongue, I prithee, it curvets\\n,unseasonably He was furnished like a hunter\\n,O, ominous! he comes to kill my heart\\n,I would sing my song without a burden: thou bringest\\n,me out of tune\\n,Do you not know I am a woman? when I think, I must\\n,speak Sweet, say on\\n,You bring me out Soft! comes he not here?\\n,Enter ORLANDO and JAQUES\\n,Tis he: slink by, and note him\\n,I thank you for your company, but, good faith, I had\\n,as lief have been myself alone\\n,And so had I, but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you\\n,too for your society\\n,God be wi you: lets meet as little as we can\\n,I do desire we may be better strangers\\n,I pray you, mar no more trees with writing\\n,love-songs in their barks\\n,I pray you, mar no more of my verses with reading\\n,them ill-favouredly\\n,Rosalind is your loves name?\\n,Yes, just\\n,I do not like her name\\n,There was no thought of pleasing you when she was\\n,christened\\n,What stature is she of?\\n,Just as high as my heart\\n,You are full of pretty answers Have you not been\\n,acquainted with goldsmiths wives, and conned them\\n,out of rings?\\n,Not so, but I answer you right painted cloth, from\\n,whence you have studied your questions\\n,You have a nimble wit: I think twas made of\\n,Atalantas heels Will you sit down with me? and\\n,we two will rail against our mistress the world and\\n,all our misery\\n,I will chide no breather in the world but myself,\\n,against whom I know most faults\\n,The worst fault you have is to be in love\\n,Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue\\n,I am weary of you\\n,By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found\\n,you\\n,He is drowned in the brook: look but in, and you\\n,shall see him\\n,There I shall see mine own figure\\n,Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher\\n,Ill tarry no longer with you: farewell, good\\n,Signior Love\\n,I am glad of your departure: adieu, good Monsieur\\n,Melancholy\\n,Exit JAQUES\\n,[Aside to CELIA]  I will speak to him, like a saucy\\n,lackey and under that habit play the knave with him\\n,Do you hear, forester?\\n,Very well: what would you?\\n,I pray you, what ist oclock?\\n,You should ask me what time o day: theres no clock\\n,in the forest\\n,Then there is no true lover in the forest, else\\n,sighing every minute and groaning every hour would\\n,detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock\\n,And why not the swift foot of Time? had not that\\n,been as proper?\\n,By no means, sir: Time travels in divers paces with\\n,divers persons Ill tell you who Time ambles\\n,withal, who Time trots withal, who Time gallops\\n,withal and who he stands still withal\\n,I prithee, who doth he trot withal?\\n,Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the\\n,contract of her marriage and the day it is\\n,solemnized: if the interim be but a sennight,\\n,Times pace is so hard that it seems the length of\\n,seven year\\n,Who ambles Time withal?\\n,With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that\\n,hath not the gout, for the one sleeps easily because\\n,he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because\\n,he feels no pain, the one lacking the burden of lean\\n,and wasteful learning, the other knowing no burden\\n,of heavy tedious penury, these Time ambles withal\\n,Who doth he gallop withal?\\n,With a thief to the gallows, for though he go as\\n,softly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there\\n,Who stays it still withal?\\n,With lawyers in the vacation, for they sleep between\\n,term and term and then they perceive not how Time moves\\n,Where dwell you, pretty youth?\\n,With this shepherdess, my sister, here in the\\n,skirts of the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat\\n,Are you native of this place?\\n,As the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled\\n,Your accent is something finer than you could\\n,purchase in so removed a dwelling\\n,I have been told so of many: but indeed an old\\n,religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was\\n,in his youth an inland man, one that knew courtship\\n,too well, for there he fell in love I have heard\\n,him read many lectures against it, and I thank God\\n,I am not a woman, to be touched with so many\\n,giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their\\n,whole sex withal\\n,Can you remember any of the principal evils that he\\n,laid to the charge of women?\\n,There were none principal, they were all like one\\n,another as half-pence are, every one fault seeming\\n,monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it\\n,I prithee, recount some of them\\n,No, I will not cast away my physic but on those that\\n,are sick There is a man haunts the forest, that\\n,abuses our young plants with carving Rosalind on\\n,their barks, hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies\\n,on brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name of\\n,Rosalind: if I could meet that fancy-monger I would\\n,give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the\\n,quotidian of love upon him\\n,I am he that is so love-shaked: I pray you tell me\\n,your remedy\\n,There is none of my uncles marks upon you: he\\n,taught me how to know a man in love, in which cage\\n,of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner\\n,What were his marks?\\n,A lean cheek, which you have not, a blue eye and\\n,sunken, which you have not, an unquestionable\\n,spirit, which you have not, a beard neglected,\\n,which you have not, but I pardon you for that, for\\n,simply your having in beard is a younger brothers\\n,revenue: then your hose should be ungartered, your\\n,bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe\\n,untied and every thing about you demonstrating a\\n,careless desolation, but you are no such man, you\\n,are rather point-device in your accoutrements as\\n,loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other\\n,Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love\\n,Me believe it! you may as soon make her that you\\n,love believe it, which, I warrant, she is apter to\\n,do than to confess she does: that is one of the\\n,points in the which women still give the lie to\\n,their consciences But, in good sooth, are you he\\n,that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind\\n,is so admired?\\n,I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of\\n,Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he\\n,But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?\\n,Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much\\n,Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves\\n,as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do: and\\n,the reason why they are not so punished and cured\\n,is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers\\n,are in love too Yet I profess curing it by counsel\\n,Did you ever cure any so?\\n,Yes, one, and in this manner He was to imagine me\\n,his love, his mistress, and I set him every day to\\n,woo me: at which time would I, being but a moonish\\n,youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing\\n,and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow,\\n,inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every\\n,passion something and for no passion truly any\\n,thing, as boys and women are for the most part\\n,cattle of this colour, would now like him, now loathe\\n,him, then entertain him, then forswear him, now weep\\n,for him, then spit at him, that I drave my suitor\\n,from his mad humour of love to a living humour of\\n,madness, which was, to forswear the full stream of\\n,the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic\\n,And thus I cured him, and this way will I take upon\\n,me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheeps\\n,heart, that there shall not be one spot of love int\\n,I would not be cured, youth\\n,I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind\\n,and come every day to my cote and woo me\\n,Now, by the faith of my love, I will: tell me\\n,where it is\\n,Go with me to it and Ill show it you and by the way\\n,you shall tell me where in the forest you live\\n,Will you go?\\n,With all my heart, good youth\\n,Nay you must call me Rosalind Come, sister, will you go?\\n,Exeunt\\n, III The forest\\n,Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY, JAQUES behind\\n,Come apace, good Audrey: I will fetch up your\\n,goats, Audrey And how, Audrey? am I the man yet?\\n,doth my simple feature content you?\\n,Your features! Lord warrant us! what features!\\n,I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most\\n,capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths\\n,[Aside]  O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove\\n,in a thatched house!\\n,When a mans verses cannot be understood, nor a\\n,mans good wit seconded with the forward child\\n,Understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a\\n,great reckoning in a little room Truly, I would\\n,the gods had made thee poetical\\n,I do not know what poetical is: is it honest in\\n,deed and word? is it a true thing?\\n,No, truly, for the truest poetry is the most\\n,feigning, and lovers are given to poetry, and what\\n,they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign\\n,Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?\\n,I do, truly, for thou swearest to me thou art\\n,honest: now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some\\n,hope thou didst feign\\n,Would you not have me honest?\\n,No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favoured, for\\n,honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar\\n,[Aside]  A material fool!\\n,Well, I am not fair, and therefore I pray the gods\\n,make me honest\\n,Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut\\n,were to put good meat into an unclean dish\\n,I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul\\n,Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness!\\n,sluttishness may come hereafter But be it as it may\\n,be, I will marry thee, and to that end I have been\\n,with Sir Oliver Martext, the vicar of the next\\n,village, who hath promised to meet me in this place\\n,of the forest and to couple us\\n,[Aside]  I would fain see this meeting\\n,Well, the gods give us joy!\\n,Amen A man may, if he were of a fearful heart,\\n,stagger in this attempt, for here we have no temple\\n,but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts But what\\n,though? C ourage! As horns are odious, they are\\n,necessary It is said, many a man knows no end of\\n,his goods: right, many a man has good horns, and\\n,knows no end of them Well, that is the dowry of\\n,his wife, tis none of his own getting Horns?\\n,Even so Poor men alone? No, no, the noblest deer\\n,hath them as huge as the rascal Is the single man\\n,therefore blessed?

more\\n,monstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting\\n,Shes a most triumphant lady, if report be square to\\n,her\\n,When she first met Mark Antony, she pursed up\\n,his heart, upon the river of Cydnus\\n,There she appeared indeed, or my reporter devised\\n,well for her\\n,I will tell you\\n,The barge she sat in, like a burnishd throne,\\n,Burnd on the water: the poop was beaten gold,\\n,Purple the sails, and so perfumed that\\n,The winds were love-sick with them, the oars were silver,\\n,Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made\\n,The water which they beat to follow faster,\\n,As amorous of their strokes For her own person,\\n,It beggard all description: she did lie\\n,In her pavilioncloth-of-gold of tissue\\n,Oer-picturing that Venus where we see\\n,The fancy outwork nature: on each side her\\n,Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,\\n,With divers-colourd fans, whose wind did seem\\n,To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,\\n,And what they undid did\\n,O, rare for Antony!\\n,Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,\\n,So many mermaids, tended her i the eyes,\\n,And made their bends adornings: at the helm\\n,A seeming mermaid steers: the silken tackle\\n,Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands,\\n,That yarely frame the office From the barge\\n,A strange invisible perfume hits the sense\\n,Of the adjacent wharfs The city cast\\n,Her people out upon her, and Antony,\\n,Enthroned i the market-place, did sit alone,\\n,Whistling to the air, which, but for vacancy,\\n,Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,\\n,And made a gap in nature\\n,Rare Egyptian!\\n,Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,\\n,Invited her to supper: she replied,\\n,It should be better he became her guest,\\n,Which she entreated: our courteous Antony,\\n,Whom neer the word of No woman heard speak,\\n,Being barberd ten times oer, goes to the feast,\\n,And for his ordinary pays his heart\\n,For what his eyes eat only\\n,Royal wench!\\n,She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed:\\n,He ploughd her, and she croppd\\n,I saw her once\\n,Hop forty paces through the public street,\\n,And having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted,\\n,That she did make defect perfection,\\n,And, breathless, power breathe forth\\n,Now Antony must leave her utterly\\n,Never, he will not:\\n,Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale\\n,Her infinite variety: other women cloy\\n,The appetites they feed: but she makes hungry\\n,Where most she satisfies, for vilest things\\n,Become themselves in her: that the holy priests\\n,Bless her when she is riggish\\n,If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle\\n,The heart of Antony, Octavia is\\n,A blessed lottery to him\\n,Let us go\\n,Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guest\\n,Whilst you abide

thee, is\\n,Noble, courageous high, unmatchable,\\n,Where Caesars is not, but, near him, thy angel\\n,Becomes a fear, as being oerpowerd: therefore\\n,Make space enough between you\\n,Speak this no more\\n,To none but thee, no more, but when to thee\\n,If thou dost play with him at any game,\\n,Thou art sure to lose, and, of that natural luck,\\n,He beats thee gainst the odds: thy lustre thickens,\\n,When he shines by: I say again, thy spirit\\n,Is all afraid to govern thee near him,\\n,But, he away, tis noble\\n,Get thee gone:\\n,Say to Ventidius I would speak with him:\\n,Exit

make\\n,A greater crack: the round world\\n,Should have shook lions into civil streets,\\n,And citizens to their dens: the death of Antony\\n,Is not a single doom, in the name lay\\n,A moiety of the world\\n,He is dead, Caesar:\\n,Not by a public minister of justice,\\n,Nor by a hired knife, but that self hand,\\n,Which writ his honour in the acts it did,\\n,Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,\\n,Splitted the heart This is his sword,\\n,I robbd his wound of it, behold it staind\\n,With his most noble blood\\n,Look you sad, friends?\\n,The gods rebuke me, but it is tidings\\n,To

their houses, bearing thence\\n,Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like\\n,Once did I get him bound and sent him home,\\n,Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went,\\n,That here and there his fury

do you?\\n,Why, how are we censured?\\n,Because you talk of pride now,will you not be angry?\\n,Well, well, sir, well\\n,Why, tis no great matter, for a very little thief of\\n,occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience:\\n,give your dispositions the reins, and be angry at\\n,your pleasures, at the least if you take it as a\\n,pleasure to you in being so You blame Marcius for\\n,being proud?\\n,We do it not alone, sir\\n,I know you can do very little alone, for your helps\\n,are many, or else your actions would grow wondrous\\n,single: your abilities are too infant-like for\\n,doing much alone You talk of pride: O that you\\n,could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks,\\n,and make but an interior survey of your good selves!\\n,O that you could!\\n,What then, sir?\\n,Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,\\n,proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, as\\n,any in Rome\\n,Menenius, you are known well enough too\\n,I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that\\n,loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying\\n,Tiber int, said to be something imperfect in\\n,favouring the first complaint, hasty and tinder-like\\n,upon too trivial motion, one that converses more\\n,with the buttock of the night than with the forehead\\n,of the morning: what I think I utter, and spend my\\n,malice in my breath Meeting two such wealsmen as\\n,you areI cannot call you Lycurgusesif the drink\\n,you give me touch my palate adversely, I make a\\n,crooked face at it I cant say your worships have\\n,delivered the matter well, when I find the ass in\\n,compound with the major part of your syllables: and\\n,though I must be content to bear with those that say\\n,you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that\\n,tell you you have good faces If you see this in\\n,the map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known\\n,well enough too? what barm can your bisson\\n,conspectuities glean out of this character, if I be\\n,known well enough too?\\n,Come, sir, come, we know you well enough\\n,You know neither me, yourselves nor any thing You\\n,are ambitious for poor knaves caps and legs: you\\n,wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a\\n,cause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller,\\n,and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a\\n,second day of audience When you are hearing a\\n,matter between party and party, if you chance to be\\n,pinched with the colic, you make faces like\\n,mummers, set up the bloody flag against all\\n,patience, and, in roaring for a chamber-pot,\\n,dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled\\n,by your hearing: all the peace you make in their\\n,cause is, calling both the parties knaves You are\\n,a pair of strange ones\\n,Come, come, you are well understood to be a\\n,perfecter giber for the table than a necessary\\n,bencher in the Capitol\\n,Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall\\n,encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are When\\n,you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the\\n,wagging of your beards, and your beards deserve not\\n,so honourable a grave as to stuff a botchers\\n,cushion, or to be entombed in an asss pack-\\n,saddle Yet you must be saying, Marcius is proud,\\n,who in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessors\\n,since Deucalion, though peradventure some of the\\n,best of em were hereditary hangmen God-den to\\n,your worships: more of your conversation would\\n,infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly\\n,plebeians: I will be bold to take my leave of you\\n,BRUTUS and SICINIUS go aside\\n,Enter VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, and VALERIA\\n,How now, my as fair as noble ladies,and the moon,\\n,were she earthly, no nobler,whither do you follow\\n,your eyes so fast?\\n,Honourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches, for\\n,the love of Juno, lets go\\n,Ha!

I do shade my head,\\n,The good patricians must be visited,\\n,From whom I have received not only greetings,\\n,But with them change of honours\\n,I have lived\\n,To see inherited my very wishes\\n,And the buildings of my fancy: only\\n,Theres one thing wanting, which I doubt not but\\n,Our Rome will cast upon thee\\n,Know, good mother,\\n,I had rather be their servant in my way,\\n,Than sway with them in theirs\\n,On, to the Capitol!\\n,Flourish Cornets Exeunt in state, as before BRUTUS and SICINIUS come forward\\n,All tongues speak of him, and the bleared sights\\n,Are spectacled to see him: your prattling nurse\\n,Into a rapture lets her baby cry\\n,While she chats him: the kitchen malkin pins\\n,Her richest lockram bout her reechy neck,\\n,Clambering the walls to eye him: stalls, bulks, windows,\\n,Are smotherd up, leads filld, and ridges horsed\\n,With variable complexions, all agreeing\\n,In earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamens\\n,Do press among the popular throngs and puff\\n,To win a vulgar station: or veild dames\\n,Commit the war of white and damask in\\n,Their nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil\\n,Of Phoebus burning kisses: such a pother\\n,As if that whatsoever god who leads him\\n,Were slily crept into his human powers\\n,And gave him graceful posture\\n,On the sudden,\\n,I warrant him consul\\n,Then our office may,\\n,During his power, go sleep\\n,He cannot temperately transport his honours\\n,From where he should begin and end, but will\\n,Lose those he hath won\\n,In that theres comfort\\n,Doubt not\\n,The commoners, for whom we stand, but they\\n,Upon their ancient malice will forget\\n,With the least cause these his new honours, which\\n,That he will give them make I as little question\\n,As he is proud to dot\\n,I heard him swear,\\n,Were he to stand for consul, never would he\\n,Appear i the market-place nor on him put\\n,The napless vesture of humility,\\n,Nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds\\n,To the people, beg their stinking breaths\\n,Tis right\\n,It was his word: O, he would miss it rather\\n,Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him,\\n,And the desire of the nobles\\n,I wish no better\\n,Than have him hold that purpose and to put it\\n,In execution\\n,Tis most like he will\\n,It shall be to him then as our good wills,\\n,A sure destruction\\n,So it must fall out\\n,To him or our authorities For an end,\\n,We must suggest the people in what hatred\\n,He still hath held them, that tos power he would\\n,Have made them mules, silenced their pleaders and\\n,Dispropertied their freedoms, holding them,\\n,In human action and capacity,\\n,Of no more soul nor fitness for the world\\n,Than camels in the war, who have their provand\\n,Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows\\n,For sinking under them\\n,This, as you say, suggested\\n,At some time when his soaring insolence\\n,Shall touch the peoplewhich time shall not want,\\n,If he be put upon t, and thats as easy\\n,As to set dogs on sheepwill be his fire\\n,To kindle their dry stubble, and their blaze\\n,Shall darken him for ever\\n,Enter a Messenger\\n,Whats the matter?\\n,You are sent for to the Capitol Tis thought\\n,That Marcius shall be consul:\\n,I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and\\n,The blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,\\n,Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,\\n,Upon him as he passd: the nobles bended,\\n,As to Joves statue, and the commons made\\n,A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts:\\n,I never saw the like\\n,Lets to the Capitol,\\n,And carry with us ears and eyes for the time,\\n,But hearts for the event\\n,Have with you\\n,Exeunt\\n, II The same The Capitol\\n,Enter two Officers, to lay cushions\\n,Come, come, they are almost here How many stand\\n,for consulships?\\n,Three, they say: but tis thought of every one\\n,Coriolanus will carry it\\n,Thats a brave fellow, but hes vengeance proud, and\\n,loves not the common people\\n,Faith, there had been many great men that have\\n,flattered the people, who neer loved them, and there\\n,be many that they have loved, they know not\\n,wherefore: so that, if they love they know not why,\\n,they hate upon no better a ground: therefore, for\\n,Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate\\n,him manifests the true knowledge he has in their\\n,disposition, and out of his noble carelessness lets\\n,them plainly seet\\n,If he did not care whether he had their love or no,\\n,he waved indifferently twixt doing them neither\\n,good nor harm: but he seeks their hate with greater\\n,devotion than can render it him, and leaves\\n,nothing undone that may fully discover him their\\n,opposite Now, to seem to affect the malice and\\n,displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he\\n,dislikes, to flatter them for their love\\n,He hath deserved worthily of his country: and his\\n,ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who,\\n,having been supple and courteous to the people,\\n,bonneted, without any further deed to have them at\\n,an into their estimation and report: but he hath so\\n,planted his honours in their eyes, and his actions\\n,in their hearts, that for their tongues to be\\n,silent, and not confess so much, were a kind of\\n,ingrateful injury, to report otherwise, were a\\n,malice, that, giving itself the lie, would pluck\\n,reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it\\n,No more of him, he is a worthy man: make way, they\\n,are coming\\n,A sennet Enter, with actors before them, COMINIUS  the consul, MENENIUS, CORIOLANUS, Senators,  SICINIUS and BRUTUS The Senators take their  places, the Tribunes take their Places by themselves CORIOLANUS stands\\n,Having determined of the Volsces and\\n,To send for Titus Lartius, it remains,\\n,As the main point of this our after-meeting,\\n,To gratify his noble service that\\n,Hath thus stood for his country: therefore,\\n,please you,\\n,Most reverend and grave elders, to desire\\n,The present consul, and last general\\n,In our well-found successes, to report\\n,A little of that worthy work performd\\n,By Caius Marcius Coriolanus, whom\\n,We met here both to thank and to remember\\n,With honours like himself\\n,Speak, good Cominius:\\n,Leave nothing out for length, and make us think\\n,Rather our states defective for requital\\n,Than we to stretch it out\\n,To the Tribunes\\n,Masters o the people,\\n,We do request your kindest ears, and after,\\n,Your loving motion toward the common body,\\n,To yield what passes here\\n,We are convented\\n,Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts\\n,Inclinable to honour and advance\\n,The theme of our assembly\\n,Which the rather\\n,We shall be blest to do, if he remember\\n,A kinder value of the people than\\n,He hath hereto prized them at\\n,Thats off, thats off,\\n,I would you rather had been silent Please you\\n,To hear Cominius speak?\\n,Most willingly,\\n,But yet my caution was more pertinent\\n,Than the rebuke you give it\\n,He loves your people\\n,But tie him not to be their bedfellow\\n,Worthy Cominius, speak\\n,CORIOLANUS offers to go away\\n,Nay, keep your place\\n,Sit, Coriolanus, never shame to hear\\n,What you have nobly done\\n,Your horrors pardon:\\n,I had rather have my wounds to heal again\\n,Than hear say how I got them\\n,Sir, I hope\\n,My words disbenchd you not\\n,No, sir: yet oft,\\n,When blows have made me stay, I fled from words\\n,You soothed not, therefore hurt not: but\\n,your people,\\n,I love them as they weigh\\n,Pray now, sit down\\n,I had rather have one scratch my head i the sun\\n,When the alarum were struck than idly sit\\n,To hear my nothings monsterd\\n,Exit\\n,Masters of the people,\\n,Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter\\n,Thats thousand to one good onewhen you now see\\n,He had rather venture all his limbs for honour\\n,Than one ons ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius\\n,I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus\\n,Should not be utterd feebly It is held\\n,That valour is the chiefest virtue, and\\n,Most dignifies the haver: if it be,\\n,The man I speak of cannot in the world\\n,Be singly counterpoised At sixteen years,\\n,When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought\\n,Beyond the mark of others: our then dictator,\\n,Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,\\n,When with his Amazonian chin he drove\\n,The bristled lips before him: be bestrid\\n,An oer-pressd Roman and i the consuls view\\n,Slew three opposers: Tarquins self he met,\\n,And struck him on his knee: in that days feats,\\n,When he might act the woman in the scene,\\n,He proved best man i the field, and for his meed\\n,Was brow-bound with the oak His pupil age\\n,Man-enterd thus, he waxed like a sea,\\n,And in the brunt of seventeen battles since\\n,He lurchd all swords of the garland For this last,\\n,Before and in Corioli, let me say,\\n,I cannot speak him home: he stoppd the fliers,\\n,And by his rare example made the coward\\n,Turn terror into sport: as weeds before\\n,A vessel under sail, so men obeyd\\n,And fell below his stem: his sword, deaths stamp,\\n,Where it did mark, it took, from face to foot\\n,He was a thing of blood, whose every motion\\n,Was timed with dying cries: alone he enterd\\n,The mortal gate of the city, which he painted\\n,With shunless destiny, aidless came off,\\n,And with a sudden reinforcement struck\\n,Corioli like a planet: now alls his:\\n,When, by and by, the din of war gan pierce\\n,His ready sense, then straight his doubled spirit\\n,Re-quickend what in flesh was fatigate,\\n,And to the battle came he, where he did\\n,Run reeking oer the lives of men, as if\\n,Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we calld\\n,Both field and city ours, he never stood\\n,To ease his breast with panting\\n,Worthy man!\\n,He cannot but with measure fit the honours\\n,Which we devise him\\n,Our spoils he kickd at,\\n,And lookd upon things precious as they were\\n,The common muck of the world: he covets less\\n,Than misery itself would give, rewards\\n,His deeds with doing them, and is content\\n,To spend the time to end it\\n,Hes right noble:\\n,Let him be calld for\\n,Call Coriolanus\\n,He doth appear\\n,Re-enter CORIOLANUS\\n,The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased\\n,To make thee consul\\n,I do owe them still\\n,My life and services\\n,It then remains\\n,That you do speak to the people\\n,I do beseech you,\\n,Let me oerleap that custom, for I cannot\\n,Put on the gown, stand naked and entreat them,\\n,For my wounds sake, to give their suffrage: please you\\n,That I may pass this doing\\n,Sir, the people\\n,Must have their voices, neither will they bate\\n,One jot of ceremony\\n,Put them not tot:\\n,Pray you, go fit you to the custom and\\n,Take to you, as your predecessors have,\\n,Your honour with your form\\n,It is apart\\n,That I shall blush in acting, and might well\\n,Be taken from the people\\n,Mark you that?\\n,To brag unto them, thus I did, and thus,\\n,Show them the unaching scars which I should hide,\\n,As if I had received them for the hire\\n,Of their breath only!\\n,Do not stand upont\\n,We recommend to you, tribunes of the people,\\n,Our purpose to them: and to our noble consul\\n,Wish we all joy and honour\\n,To Coriolanus come all joy and honour!\\n,Flourish of cornets Exeunt all but SICINIUS and BRUTUS\\n,You see how he intends to use the people\\n,May they perceives intent! He will require them,\\n,As if he did contemn what he requested\\n,Should be in them to give\\n,Come, well inform them\\n,Of our proceedings here: on the marketplace,\\n,I know, they do attend us\\n,Exeunt\\n, III The same The Forum\\n,Enter seven or eight Citizens\\n,Once, if he do require our voices, we ought not to deny him\\n,We may, sir, if we will\\n,We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a\\n,power that we have no power to do, for if he show us\\n,his wounds and tell us his deeds, we are to put our\\n,tongues into those wounds and speak for them, so, if\\n,he tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell him\\n,our noble acceptance of them Ingratitude is\\n,monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful,\\n,were to make a monster of the multitude: of the\\n,which we being members, should bring ourselves to be\\n,monstrous members\\n,And to make us no better thought of, a little help\\n,will serve, for once we stood up about the corn, he\\n,himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude\\n,We have been called so of many, not that our heads\\n,are some brown, some black, some auburn, some bald,\\n,but that our wits are so diversely coloured: and\\n,truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of\\n,one skull, they would fly east, west, north, south,\\n,and their consent of one direct way should be at\\n,once to all the points o the compass\\n,Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit would\\n,fly?\\n,Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another mans\\n,will,tis strongly wedged up in a block-head, but\\n,if it were at liberty, twould, sure, southward\\n,Why that way?\\n,To lose itself in a fog, where being three parts\\n,melted away with rotten dews, the fourth would return\\n,for conscience sake, to help to get thee a wife\\n,You are never without your tricks: you may, you may\\n,Are you all resolved to give your voices?

I tell thee,\\n,We have a power on foot, and I had purpose\\n,Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,\\n,Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out\\n,Twelve several times, and I have nightly since\\n,Dreamt of encounters twixt thyself and me,\\n,We have been down together in my sleep,\\n,Unbuckling helms, fisting each others throat,\\n,And waked half dead with nothing Worthy Marcius,\\n,Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that\\n,Thou art thence banishd, we would muster all\\n,From twelve to seventy, and pouring war\\n,Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,\\n,Like a bold flood oer-bear O, come, go in,\\n,And take our friendly senators by the hands,\\n,Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,\\n,Who am prepared against your territories,\\n,Though not for Rome itself\\n,You bless me, gods!\\n,Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt have\\n,The leading of thine own revenges, take\\n,The one half of my commission, and set down\\n,As best thou art experienced, since thou knowst\\n,Thy countrys strength and weakness,thine own ways,\\n,Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,\\n,Or rudely visit them in parts remote,\\n,To fright them, ere destroy But come in:\\n,Let me commend thee first to those that shall\\n,Say yea to thy desires A thousand welcomes!\\n,And more a friend than eer an enemy,\\n,Yet, Marcius, that was much Your hand: most welcome!\\n,Exeunt CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS The two Servingmen come forward\\n,Heres a strange alteration!\\n,By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with\\n,a cudgel, and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a\\n,false report of him\\n,What an arm he has! he turned me about with his\\n,finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top\\n,Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in\\n,him: he had, sir, a kind of face, methought,I\\n,cannot tell how to term it\\n,He had so, looking as it werewould I were hanged,\\n,but I thought there was more in him than I could think\\n,So did I, Ill be sworn: he is simply the rarest\\n,man i the world\\n,I think he is: but a greater soldier than he you wot on\\n,Who, my master?\\n,Nay, its no matter for that\\n,Worth six on him\\n,Nay, not so neither: but I take him to be the\\n,greater soldier\\n,Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that:\\n,for the defence of a town, our general is excellent\\n,Ay, and for an assault too\\n,Re-enter third Servingman\\n,O slaves, I can tell you news, news, you rascals!\\n,What, what, what? lets partake\\n,I would not be a Roman, of all nations, I had as\\n,lieve be a condemned man\\n,Wherefore? wherefore?\\n,Why, heres he that was wont to thwack our general,\\n,Caius Marcius\\n,Why do you say thwack our general ?\\n,I do not say thwack our general, but he was always\\n,good enough for him\\n,Come, we are fellows and friends: he was ever too\\n,hard for him, I have heard him say so himself\\n,He was too hard for him directly, to say the troth\\n,ont: before Corioli he scotched him and notched\\n,him like a carbon ado\\n,An he had been cannibally given, he might have\\n,broiled and eaten him too\\n,But, more of thy news?\\n,Why, he is so made on here within, as if he were son\\n,and heir to Mars, set at upper end o the table, no\\n,question asked him by any of the senators, but they\\n,stand bald before him: our general himself makes a\\n,mistress of him: sanctifies himself withs hand and\\n,turns up the white o the eye to his discourse But\\n,the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i\\n,the middle and but one half of what he was\\n,yesterday, for the other has half, by the entreaty\\n,and grant of the whole table Hell go, he says,\\n,and sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears: he\\n,will mow all down before him, and leave his passage polled\\n,And hes as like to dot as any man I can imagine\\n,Dot! he will dot, for, look you, sir, he has as\\n,many friends as enemies, which friends, sir, as it\\n,were, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, as\\n,we term it, his friends whilst hes in directitude\\n,Directitude! whats that?\\n,But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again,\\n,and the man in blood, they will out of their\\n,burrows, like conies after rain, and revel all with\\n,him\\n,But when goes this forward?\\n,To-morrow, to-day, presently, you shall have the\\n,drum struck up this afternoon: tis, as it were, a\\n,parcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they\\n,wipe their lips\\n,Why, then we shall have a stirring world again\\n,This peace is nothing, but to rust iron, increase\\n,tailors, and breed ballad-makers\\n,Let me have war, say I, it exceeds peace as far as\\n,day does night, its spritely, waking, audible, and\\n,full of vent Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy,\\n,mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible, a getter of more\\n,bastard children than wars a destroyer of men\\n,Tis so: and as war, in some sort, may be said to\\n,be a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a\\n,great maker of cuckolds\\n,Ay, and it makes men hate one another\\n,Reason, because they then less need one another\\n,The wars for my money I hope to see Romans as cheap\\n,as Volscians They are rising, they are rising\\n,In, in, in, in!\\n,Exeunt\\n, VI Rome A public place\\n,Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS\\n,We hear not of him, neither need we fear him,\\n,His

commonwealth doth stand, and so would do,\\n,Were he more angry at it\\n,Alls well, and might have been much better, if\\n,He could have temporized\\n,Where is he, hear you?\\n,Nay, I hear nothing: his mother and his wife\\n,Hear nothing from him\\n,Enter three or four Citizens\\n,The gods preserve you both!\\n,God-den, our neighbours\\n,God-den to you all, god-den to you all\\n,Ourselves, our wives, and children, on our knees,\\n,Are bound to pray for you both\\n,Live, and thrive!\\n,Farewell, kind neighbours: we wishd Coriolanus\\n,Had loved you as we did\\n,Now the gods keep you!\\n,Farewell, farewell\\n,Exeunt Citizens\\n,This is a happier and more comely time\\n,Than when these fellows ran about the streets,\\n,Crying confusion\\n,Caius Marcius was\\n,A worthy officer i the war, but insolent,\\n,Oercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,\\n,Self-loving,\\n,And affecting one sole throne,\\n,Without assistance\\n,I think not so\\n,We should by this, to all our

talk you\\n,Of Marcius?\\n,Go see this rumourer whippd It cannot be\\n,The Volsces dare break with us\\n,Cannot be!\\n,We have record that very well it can,\\n,And three examples of the like have been\\n,Within my age But reason with the fellow,\\n,Before you punish him, where he heard this,\\n,Lest you shall chance to whip your information\\n,And beat the messenger who bids beware\\n,Of what is to be dreaded\\n,Tell not me:\\n,I know this cannot be\\n,Not possible\\n,Enter a Messenger\\n,The nobles in great earnestness are going\\n,All to the senate-house: some news is come\\n,That turns

deliverd\\n,What more fearful?\\n,It is spoke freely out of many mouths\\n,How probable I do not knowthat Marcius,\\n,Joind with Aufidius, leads a power gainst Rome,\\n,And vows revenge as spacious as between\\n,The youngst and oldest thing\\n,This is most likely!\\n,Raised only, that the weaker sort may wish\\n,Good Marcius home again\\n,The very trick ont\\n,This is unlikely:\\n,He and Aufidius can no more atone\\n,Than violentest contrariety\\n,Enter a second Messenger\\n,You are sent for to the senate:\\n,A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius\\n,Associated with Aufidius, rages\\n,Upon our

Volscians,\\n,If!\\n,He is their god: he leads them like a thing\\n,Made by some other deity than nature,\\n,That shapes man better, and they follow him,\\n,Against us brats, with no less confidence\\n,Than boys pursuing summer butterflies,\\n,Or butchers killing flies\\n,You have made good work,\\n,You and your apron-men, you that stood so up much\\n,on the voice of occupation

of the shepherds: for his best friends, if they\\n,Should say Be good to Rome, they charged him even\\n,As those should do that had deserved his hate,\\n,And therein showd like enemies\\n,Tis true:\\n,If he were putting to my house the brand\\n,That should consume it, I have not the face\\n,To say Beseech you, cease You have made fair hands,\\n,You and your crafts! you have crafted fair!\\n,You have brought\\n,A trembling upon Rome, such as was never\\n,So incapable of help\\n,Say not we brought it\\n,How!

Thou knowst, great son,\\n,The end of wars uncertain, but this certain,\\n,That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit\\n,Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name,\\n,Whose repetition will be doggd with curses,\\n,Whose chronicle thus writ: The man was noble,\\n,But with his last attempt he wiped it out,\\n,Destroyd his country, and his name remains\\n,To the ensuing age abhorrd Speak to me, son:\\n,Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,\\n,To imitate the graces of the gods,\\n,To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o the air,\\n,And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt\\n,That should but rive an oak Why dost not speak?\\n,Thinkst thou it honourable for a noble man\\n,Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:\\n,He cares not for your weeping Speak thou, boy:\\n,Perhaps thy childishness will move him more\\n,Than can our reasons Theres no man in the world\\n,More bound to s mother, yet here he lets me prate\\n,Like one i the stocks Thou hast never in thy life\\n,Showd thy dear mother any courtesy,\\n,When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,\\n,Has cluckd thee to the wars and safely home,\\n,Loaden with honour Say my requests unjust,\\n,And spurn me back: but if it be not so,\\n,Thou art not honest, and the gods will plague thee,\\n,That thou restrainst from me the duty which\\n,To a mothers part belongs He turns away:\\n,Down, ladies, let us shame him with our knees\\n,To his surname Coriolanus longs more pride\\n,Than pity to our prayers Down: an end,\\n,This is the last: so we will home to Rome,\\n,And die among our neighbours Nay, behold s:\\n,This boy, that cannot tell what he would have\\n,But kneels and holds up bands for fellowship,\\n,Does reason our petition with more strength\\n,Than thou hast to deny t Come, let us go:\\n,This fellow had a Volscian to his mother,\\n,His wife is in Corioli and his child\\n,Like him by chance Yet give us our dispatch:\\n,I am hushd until our city be a-fire,\\n,And then Ill speak a little\\n,He holds her by the hand, silent\\n,O mother, mother!\\n,What have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope,\\n,The gods look down, and this unnatural scene\\n,They laugh at O my mother, mother! O!\\n,You have won a happy victory to Rome,\\n,But, for your son,believe it, O, believe it,\\n,Most dangerously you have with him prevaild,\\n,If not most mortal to him But, let it come\\n,Aufidius,

dare be sworn you were:\\n,And, sir, it is no little thing to make\\n,Mine eyes to sweat compassion But, good sir,\\n,What peace youll make, advise me: for my part,\\n,Ill not to Rome, Ill back with you, and pray you,\\n,Stand to me in this cause O mother! wife!\\n,[Aside]  I am glad thou hast set thy mercy and\\n,thy honour\\n,At difference in thee: out of that Ill work\\n,Myself a former fortune\\n,The Ladies make signs to CORIOLANUS\\n,Ay, by and by,\\n,To VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA,  and c\\n,But we will drink together, and you shall bear\\n,A better witness back than words, which we,\\n,On like conditions, will have counter-seald\\n,Come, enter with us Ladies, you deserve\\n,To have a temple built you: all the swords\\n,In Italy, and her confederate arms,\\n,Could not have made this peace\\n,Exeunt\\n, IV Rome A public place\\n,Enter MENENIUS and SICINIUS\\n,See you yond coign o the Capitol, yond\\n,corner-stone?\\n,Why, what of that?\\n,If it be possible for you to displace it

execution\\n,Ist possible that so short a time can alter the\\n,condition of a man!\\n,There is differency between a grub and a butterfly,\\n,yet your butterfly was a grub This Marcius is grown\\n,from man to dragon: he has wings, hes more than a\\n,creeping thing\\n,He loved his mother dearly\\n,So did he me: and he no more remembers his mother\\n,now than an eight-year-old horse The tartness\\n,of his face sours ripe grapes: when he walks, he\\n,moves like an engine, and the ground shrinks before\\n,his treading: he is able to pierce a corslet with\\n,his eye, talks like a knell, and his hum is a\\n,battery He sits in his state, as a thing made for\\n,Alexander What he bids be done is finished with\\n,his bidding He wants nothing of a god but eternity\\n,and a heaven to throne in\\n,Yes, mercy, if you report him truly\\n,I paint him in the character Mark what mercy his\\n,mother shall bring from him: there is no more mercy\\n,in him than there is milk in a male tiger, that\\n,shall our poor city find: and all this is long of\\n,you\\n,The gods be good unto us!\\n,No, in such a case the gods will not be good unto\\n,us When we banished him, we respected not them,\\n,and, he returning to break our necks, they respect not us\\n,Enter a Messenger\\n,Sir, if yould save your life, fly to your house:\\n,The plebeians have got your fellow-tribune\\n,And hale

prevaild,\\n,The Volscians are dislodged, and Marcius gone:\\n,A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,\\n,No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins\\n,Friend,\\n,Art thou certain this is true? is it most certain?\\n,As certain as I know the sun is fire:\\n,Where have you lurkd, that you make doubt of it?\\n,Neer through an arch so hurried the blown tide,\\n,As the recomforted through the gates Why, hark you!\\n,Trumpets, hautboys, drums beat, all together\\n,The trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries and fifes,\\n,Tabours and cymbals and the shouting Romans,\\n,Make the sun dance Hark you!\\n,A shout within\\n,This is good news:\\n,I will go meet the ladies This Volumnia\\n,Is worth of consuls, senators, patricians,\\n,A city full, of tribunes, such as you,\\n,A sea and land full You have prayd well to-day:\\n,This morning for ten thousand of your throats\\n,Id not have given a doit Hark, how they joy!\\n,Music still, with shouts\\n,First, the gods bless you for your tidings, next,\\n,Accept my thankfulness\\n,Sir, we have all\\n,Great cause to give great thanks\\n,They are near the city?\\n,Almost at point to enter\\n,We will meet them,\\n,And help the joy\\n,Exeunt\\n, V The same A

your tribes together, praise the gods,\\n,And make triumphant fires, strew flowers before them:\\n,Unshout the noise that banishd Marcius,\\n,Repeal him with the welcome of his mother,\\n,Cry Welcome, ladies, welcome!\\n,Welcome, ladies, Welcome!\\n,A flourish with drums and trumpets Exeunt\\n, VI Antium A public place\\n,Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS, with Attendants\\n,Go tell the lords o the city I am here:\\n,Deliver them this paper: having read it,\\n,Bid them repair to the market place, where I,\\n,Even in theirs and in the commons ears,\\n,Will vouch the truth of it Him I accuse\\n,The city ports by this hath enterd and\\n,Intends to appear before the people, hoping\\n,To purge herself with words: dispatch\\n,Exeunt Attendants\\n,Enter three or four Conspirators of AUFIDIUS faction\\n,Most welcome!\\n,How is it with our general?\\n,Even so\\n,As with a man by his own alms empoisond,\\n,And with his charity slain\\n,Most noble sir,\\n,If you do hold the same intent wherein\\n,You wishd us parties, well deliver you\\n,Of your great danger\\n,Sir, I cannot tell:\\n,We must proceed as we do find the people\\n,The people will remain uncertain whilst\\n,Twixt you theres difference, but the fall of either\\n,Makes the survivor heir of all\\n,I know it,\\n,And my pretext to strike at him admits\\n,A good construction I raised him, and I pawnd\\n,Mine honour for his truth: who being so heightend,\\n,He waterd his new plants with dews of flattery,\\n,Seducing so my friends, and, to this end,\\n,He bowd his nature, never known before\\n,But to be rough, unswayable and free\\n,Sir, his stoutness\\n,When he did stand for consul, which he lost\\n,By lack of stooping,\\n,That I would have spoke of:\\n,Being banishd fort, he came unto my hearth,\\n,Presented to my knife his throat: I took him,\\n,Made him joint-servant with me, gave him way\\n,In all his own desires, nay, let him choose\\n,Out of my files, his projects to accomplish,\\n,My best and freshest men, served his designments\\n,In mine own person, holp to reap the fame\\n,Which he did end all his, and took some pride\\n,To do myself this wrong: till, at the last,\\n,I seemd his follower, not partner, and\\n,He waged me with his countenance, as if\\n,I had been mercenary\\n,So he did, my lord:\\n,The army marvelld at it, and, in the last,\\n,When he had carried Rome and that we lookd\\n,For no less spoil than glory,\\n,There was it:\\n,For which my sinews shall be stretchd upon him\\n,At a few drops of womens rheum, which are\\n,As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labour\\n,Of our great action: therefore shall he die,\\n,And Ill renew me in his fall But, hark!\\n,Drums and trumpets sound, with great shouts of the People\\n,Your native town you enterd like a post,\\n,And had no welcomes home: but he returns,\\n,Splitting the air with noise\\n,And patient fools,\\n,Whose children he hath slain, their base throats tear\\n,With giving him glory\\n,Therefore, at your vantage,\\n,Ere he express himself, or move the people\\n,With what he would say, let him feel your sword,\\n,Which we will second When he lies along,\\n,After your way his tale pronounced shall bury\\n,His reasons with his body\\n,Say no more:\\n,Here come the lords\\n,Enter the Lords of the city\\n,You are most welcome home\\n,I have not deserved it\\n,But, worthy lords, have you with heed perused\\n,What I have written to you?\\n,We have\\n,And grieve to heart\\n,What faults he made before the last, I think\\n,Might have found easy fines: but there to end\\n,Where he was to begin and give away\\n,The benefit of our levies, answering us\\n,With our own charge, making a treaty where\\n,There was a yielding,this admits no excuse\\n,He approaches: you shall hear him\\n,Enter CORIOLANUS, marching with drum and colours, commoners being with him\\n,Hail, lords! I am returnd your soldier,\\n,No more infected with my countrys love\\n,Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting\\n,Under your great command You are to know\\n,That prosperously I have attempted and\\n,With bloody passage led your wars even to\\n,The gates of Rome Our spoils we have brought home\\n,Do more than counterpoise a full third part\\n,The charges of the action We have made peace\\n,With no less honour to the Antiates\\n,Than shame to the Romans: and we here deliver,\\n,Subscribed by the consuls and patricians,\\n,Together with the seal o the senate, what\\n,We have compounded on\\n,Read it not, noble lords,\\n,But tell the traitor, in the highst degree\\n,He hath abused your powers\\n,Traitor! how now!\\n,Ay, traitor, Marcius!\\n,Marcius!\\n,Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius: dost thou think\\n,Ill grace thee with that robbery, thy stoln name\\n,Coriolanus in Corioli?\\n,You lords and heads o the state, perfidiously\\n,He has betrayd your business, and given up,\\n,For certain drops of salt, your city Rome,\\n,I say your city, to his wife and mother,\\n,Breaking his oath and resolution like\\n,A twist of rotten silk, never admitting\\n,Counsel o the war, but at his nurses tears\\n,He whined and roard away your victory,\\n,That pages blushd at him and men of heart\\n,Lookd wondering each at other\\n,Hearst thou, Mars?\\n,Name not the god, thou boy of tears!\\n,Ha!\\n,No more\\n,Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart\\n,Too great for what contains it Boy! O slave!\\n,Pardon me, lords, tis the first time that ever\\n,I was forced to scold Your judgments, my grave lords,\\n,Must give this cur the lie: and his own notion\\n,Who wears my stripes impressd upon him, that\\n,Must bear my beating to his graveshall join\\n,To thrust the lie unto him\\n,Peace, both, and hear me speak\\n,Cut me to pieces, Volsces, men and lads,\\n,Stain all your edges on me Boy! false hound!\\n,If you have writ your annals true, tis there,\\n,That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I\\n,Flutterd your Volscians in Corioli:\\n,Alone I did it Boy!\\n,Why, noble lords,\\n,Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune,\\n,Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart,\\n,Fore your own eyes and ears?\\n,Let him die fort\\n,Tear him to pieces Do it presently He killd\\n,my son My daughter He killed my cousin\\n,Marcus He killed my father\\n,Peace, ho! no outrage: peace!\\n,The man is noble and his fame folds-in\\n,This orb o the earth His last offences to us\\n,Shall have judicious hearing Stand, Aufidius,\\n,And trouble not the peace\\n,O that I had him,\\n,With six Aufidiuses, or more, his tribe,\\n,To use my lawful sword!\\n,Insolent villain!\\n,Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!\\n,The Conspirators draw, and kill CORIOLANUS: AUFIDIUS stands on his body\\n,Hold, hold, hold, hold!\\n,My noble masters, hear me speak\\n,O Tullus,\\n,Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep\\n,Tread not upon him Masters all, be quiet,\\n,Put up your swords\\n,My lords, when you shall knowas in this rage,\\n,Provoked by him, you cannotthe great danger\\n,Which this mans life did owe you, youll rejoice\\n,That he is thus cut off Please it your honours\\n,To call me to your senate, Ill deliver\\n,Myself your loyal servant, or endure\\n,Your heaviest censure\\n,Bear from hence his body,\\n,And mourn you for him: let him be regarded\\n,As the most noble corse that ever herald\\n,Did follow to his urn\\n,His own impatience\\n,Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame\\n,Lets make the best of it\\n,My rage is gone,\\n,And I am struck with sorrow Take him up\\n,Help, three o the chiefest soldiers, Ill be one\\n,Beat thou the drum, that it speak mournfully:\\n,Trail your steel pikes Though in this city he\\n,Hath widowd and unchilded many a one,\\n,Which to this hour bewail the injury,\\n,Yet he shall have a noble memory Assist\\n,Exeunt, bearing the body of CORIOLANUS A dead march sounded\\n,']\n"
